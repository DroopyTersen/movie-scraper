    "Enter the land of Tinker Bell and her four best fairy friends.",
    "Carried by the wind deep in the heart of the enchanting Pixie Hollow in the island of Neverland, the beautiful newly born fairy, Tinker Bell, discovers that her destiny as a tinker is to repair all sorts of things under the ever-watchful Queen Clarion. However, as the rebellious Tinker Bell yearns to fly along with her sisters, Iridessa, Silvermist, Rosetta, and Fawn to the mainland, she will soon realise that the arrival of spring requires special skills, hard work, and above all, faith. Will a dash of pixie dust help Tinker Bell stay true to herself?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Enter the magical world of fairies and meet the enchanting creatures of Pixie Hollow, who \"nurture nature\" and bring about the change of the seasons. Changing the colors of the leaves, moving a sunbeam to melt snow, waking animals from their winter slumber, or giving a patch of sproutlings a sprinkle of water are all within the realm of these seasonal specialists. Tinker Bell thinks her fairy talent as a \"tinker\" isn't as special or important as the other fairies' talents. But when Tink tries to change who she is, she creates nothing but disaster! With encouragement from her friends Rosetta, Silvermist, Fawn and Iridessa, Tink learns the key to solving her problems lies in her unique tinker abilities and discovers that when she's true to herself, magical things can happen."
