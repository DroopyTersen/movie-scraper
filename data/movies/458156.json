    "After gunning down a member of the High Table -- the shadowy international assassin's guild -- legendary hit man John Wick finds himself stripped of the organization's protective services. Now stuck with a $14 million bounty on his head, Wick must fight his way through the streets of New York as he becomes the target of the world's most ruthless killers.—pratham048",
    "John Wick is on the run for two reasons, as he is being hunted for a global $14 million dollar open contract on his life, and for breaking a central rule: taking a life on Continental Hotel grounds. The victim was a member of the High Table who ordered the open contract. John should have already been executed, except the Continental's manager, Winston, has given him a one-hour grace period before he's 'Excommunicado' - membership revoked, banned from all services and cut off from other members. John uses the service industry to stay alive as he fights and kills his way out of New York City.—Santhosh",
    "In the aftermath of the blood-spattered events in John Wick: Chapter 2 (2017), the legendary virtuoso of death now finds himself heavily outgunned in the dark underbelly of Manhattan's tangled urban battlefield. And with a tempting bounty placed on Wick's head and every ambitious nobody in the business itching to terminate him, the excommunicated cardinal of destruction is with his back to the wall. As a result, John has to confront pitilessly endless waves of the High Table's brutal assassins, and it's all because of a fatal mistake at the neutral Continental Hotel and a long-standing feud over an innocent puppy. Indeed, many have tried to claim John's head. However, dead men can't spend money. Now, the artist of suffering prepares for war. But what were they thinking? Don't they know who the Bogeyman is?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Less than an hour after the conclusion of the previous film, former hit-man John Wick (Keanu Reeves) is now a marked man and on the run in Manhattan. After the unsanctioned killing of crime lord and new member of the High Table Santino D'Antonio in the New York City Continental, John is declared \"Ex-Communicado\" by his handlers at the High Table and placed under a $14 million bounty. On the run from assassins, John reaches the New York Public Library and recovers a crucifix necklace and a \"marker\" medallion from a secret cache in a book. He fights his way through numerous assassins populating New York City until he reaches the Director (Anjelica Huston), a woman from his past who operates a theater. She accepts the crucifix as a \"ticket\" for safe passage to Casablanca, Morocco and has Wick branded to signify that he has used up all his favors.Meanwhile, an Adjudicator (Asia Kate Dillon) with the High Table meets with Winston (Ian McShane), the manager of the New York City Continental, and the Bowery King (Laurence Fishburne), the leader of a network of vagrant assassins. The Adjudicator admonishes both for helping John Wick kill Santino D'Antonio, and both are given seven days to give up their offices or face serious consequences.\nIn Casablanca, John meets Sofia (Halle Berry), a former friend and the manager of the Casablanca Continental. He presents his marker and asks Sofia to honor it by directing him to the Elder (Saïd Taghmaoui), a high-ranking member of the High Table (the only person senior to the high table), so that he can ask to have his bounty waived. Sofia takes him to an assassin named Berrada (Jerome Flynn), who tells John that he may find the Elder by wandering through the desert until he cannot walk any longer. In exchange for this information, Berrada asks for one of Sofia's dogs; when Sofia refuses, he shoots the dog. In retaliation, Sofia shoots Berrada, and the duo fight their way out of the Kasbah and flee into the desert.Having fulfilled her marker, Sofia leaves John in the desert. He roams until he collapses from exhaustion but is found by the Elder's men. John explains his actions, saying he is desperate to live on to \"earn\" the memory of the love he once had with his wife. The Elder agrees to forgive John but only if he assassinates Winston and continues to work for the High Table until his death. To show his commitment, John severs his ring finger and gives his wedding ring to the Elder.\nMeanwhile, the Adjudicator recruits the assassin Zero (Mark Dacascos) and his students to enforce the will of the High Table. With Zero's help, the Adjudicator accosts the Director and the Bowery King. As penance, both are maimed, the Bowery King almost fatally. John arrives back in New York City and is pursued by Zero's men. Zero nearly kills John before his pursuit is halted as they arrive at the New York City Continental, under threat of being declared Ex-Communicado. Zero reveals himself as a fan of John's, but John disregards his overtures. John meets with Winston, who encourages John not to die as a killer but as a man who loved and was loved by his wife.The Adjudicator arrives, but Winston refuses to give up his office, and John refuses to kill Winston. As a consequence, the Adjudicator \"deconsecrates\" the New York City Continental, revoking its protected neutral ground status. The Adjudicator then notifies Zero and his men and sends two busloads of body-armored High Table enforcers as their support. With the help of the hotel's concierge, Charon (Lance Reddick), John defends the Continental from the enforcers. At first, the armored enforcers easily kill most of the Continental's guards, but then John and Charon manage to kill the enforcers with armor-piercing shotgun shells. John is then ambushed by Zero and his students. John defeats and kills all but two of the students, then fatally wounds Zero.The Adjudicator negotiates a parley with Winston, who explains the rebellion as a \"show of strength\" and offers penance to the High Table. John arrives, and when the Adjudicator identifies him as a threat to the negotiation, Winston shoots John repeatedly, causing John to fall off of the Continental's roof. The New York City Continental returns to operation and is \"reconsecrated\", but the Adjudicator informs Winston that John's body has disappeared and that he remains a threat for both of them. Meanwhile, a wounded John Wick is delivered to the heavily-scarred Bowery King, who tells John he is angry with the High Table and will be fighting against them. He asks John if he also feels pissed off, and John responds with \"yeah.\""
