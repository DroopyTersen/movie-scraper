    "A teenager who's spent her whole life confined to her home falls for the boy next door.",
    "A 17-year-old girl named Madeline Whittier has a rare disease that requires her to stay indoors 24/7 with her filtered air. Her whole life, basically, is books, her mom, and her nurse Carla. One day, a moving truck pulls in next door, and out steps Olly Bright, Maddy's new neighbor. They get to know each other through emails. The more they get to know each other, the deeper in love they fall. Olly makes Maddy realize she isn't really living; this starts the adventures of her new life.—Elle3",
    "17-year-old Madeline Whittier lives with SCID, an immune disorder that prevents her from leaving her house and interacting with others. Her mother Pauline takes care of her with the help of her nurse Carla, who has been with them for 15 years. Only Pauline, Carla, and Carla's daughter Rosa are allowed in the Whittier home and around Maddy., who yearns to see the world, especially the ocean. One day, a new family moves in next door and their son, who is Maddy's age, catches her eye; they share a look as Maddy watches through the window. Later that night while Maddy and Pauline are watching a movie, the boy and his sister appear on their doorstep with a Bundt cake. Pauline politely rejects it, but as she is closing the door, the boy asks where her daughter is."

  "synopsis": "The opening scene shows Madeline \"Maddy\" Whittier (Amandla Stenberg) sitting in what she considers her favorite room in the house. It gives her a nice view of the outside, as she enjoys imagining what it would be like to set foot out there, particularly in the ocean.Maddy explains that she has always lived with a rare condition called severe combined immunodeficiency (SCID), meaning her antibodies are not able to properly fight off infection. Her mother (Anika Noni Rose) has kept her in the house for most of her life after she was a child and suffered multiple ear infections and cases of pneumonia. Maddy's brother and father also died in a car accident years earlier. Her only friends are her nurse Carla (Ana de la Reguera) and Carla's daughter Rosa (Danube R. Hermosillo), who are the only other people allowed in the house. Maddy is part of an online support group where she talks to other people with SCID. She spends most of her time immersing herself in books and writing reviews on them, as well as watching movies with her mom, or building models with an astronaut figure inside.One day, Maddy spots new neighbors moving in next door. She sees Oliver \"Olly\" Bright (Nick Robinson) riding his skateboard down the street. He looks up at Maddy's window and smiles at her. She smiles back.That night, Olly and his sister Kara (Taylor Hickson) walk over to the Whittier home to give them a bundt cake that their mom made. Dr. Whittier opens the door and politely declines the cake since it's coming from outside. When Olly asks if Maddy is around, Dr. Whittier firmly states she's not and then shuts the door.Over the next few days, Olly gets Maddy's attention from their windows. He fools around with bundt cake at first before writing his number down on the window. Maddy starts texting him and then imagines their conversation as though she were sitting in her model diner. They talk about their backgrounds, including Maddy's sickness and the deaths of her father and brother, as well as Maddy's desire to see the ocean.Both Carla and Rosa know that Maddy is into Olly. While her mother is away, Carla invites Olly to go to the house, but he must maintain a distance from Maddy so he can't get her sick. The two talk for a while and hang out.Later on, Maddy sees Olly in a fight with his father. Olly strikes the first blow before his father hits him back harder. Maddy runs outside with concern toward him. Dr. Whittier sees this and runs after Maddy. She pulls Maddy back into the house after she Maddy tries to help Olly. Dr. Whittier scolds Maddy, and then Maddy starts to throw up in the sink. Her mom puts her to rest and then gently tells her that she can't see Olly again.Dr. Whittier fires Carla for letting Olly in the house. She tearfully says goodbye to Maddy. Dr. Whittier hires a new, stricter nurse to care for Maddy. She and Olly continue to communicate privately. One afternoon, Maddy goes into her favorite room and sees that Olly taped dozens of pictures of the ocean, with a note saying that every ocean deserves to be seen by her.Maddy writes a letter to her mother saying she will be gone. She goes over to Olly's house and says she bought two plane tickets to Hawaii. Olly tells her to go back home for her safety, but Maddy claims that she's been taking a medication that is keeping her well for now. Convinced, Olly drives them both to the airport.Dr. Whittier finds Maddy's note.
