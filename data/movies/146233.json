    "When Keller Dover's daughter and her friend go missing, he takes matters into his own hands as the police pursue multiple leads and the pressure mounts.",
    "How far would you go to protect your family? Keller Dover is facing every parent's worst nightmare. His six-year-old daughter, Anna, is missing, together with her young friend, Joy, and as minutes turn to hours, panic sets in. The only lead is a dilapidated RV that had earlier been parked on their street. Heading the investigation, Detective Loki arrests its driver, Alex Jones, but a lack of evidence forces his release. As the police pursue multiple leads and pressure mounts, knowing his child's life is at stake the frantic Dover decides he has no choice but to take matters into his own hands. But just how far will this desperate father go to protect his family?—Warner Bros. Pictures",
    "In a town in northeastern Pennsylvania, Keller and Grace Dover, Franklin and Nancy Birch, and their respective offspring - each couple with a teenager and adolescent apiece - are best friends. While the two families are celebrating Thanksgiving together, the two adolescent girls, Anna Dover and Joy Birch, go missing. Based on events earlier in the day, the two families believe that the girls were abducted by whoever lives in the camper van parked in their neighborhood. Their beliefs are strengthened after they meet the resident of the camper, Alex Jones, a mentally childlike young man who is supported in every respect by his overprotective aunt, Holly Jones, and based on other subsequent evidence about Alex that emerges. However, Detective Loki, the lead police investigator, is pretty certain that Alex did not abduct the girls, he instead initially following leads of known sex offenders and pedophiles in the area. In addition, Loki has no evidence to hold Alex in custody, placing him at odds especially with Keller, who is certain that Alex is the one who abducted the girls. While Loki continues his investigation with Keller accusing him of not doing his job by following what he considers are pointless leads, Keller decides he has to take matters into his own hands. He has to decide how much he will involve Grace, Franklin and Nancy in getting Alex to divulge where the girls are by any means possible. His decisions as in who he will involve in getting Alex to talk may depend on how like-minded he believes the other three are, they who may be as devastated as he is, but who may neither be certain that Alex is the perpetrator or go to the same extremes as he to get the information from Alex.—Huggo",
    "Against the backdrop of what should have been a happy Thanksgiving dinner, a terrible case of a mysterious abduction unfolds, as Anna, the six-year-old daughter of the small-town carpenter, Keller Dover, and her best friend, Joy, vanish without a trace. As time is against the desperate father, the only lead points at troubled Alex Jones; however, due to lack of evidence, Detective Loki knows that the alleged prime suspect will soon be free. Now, the odds are against them, and Keller will have to take matters into his own hands, even if his reckless decision threatens to put his freedom at risk. Will he ever see the girls again, alive and in one piece?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Keller Dover (Hugh Jackman) and his son Ralph are hunting deer; Ralph drops a buck as Keller recites the Lord's Prayer, then smiles approvingly at the teen. On the drive home, Keller tells his son to always \"be ready.\"An old RV drives past the Dover house. Later they talk about the family finances; Ralph wonders why they don't rent out the grandfather's old apartment, Keller says it is in too poor condition.The Dover family, Keller, his wife Grace, son and daughter, walk to a neighbor's house for Thanksgiving dinner with their friends the Birches. The families have a good time together. While the adults cook, the kids go out. Anna Dover jumps on the old RV parked by the curb. They realize someone is inside and return to the Birch house. Franklin Birch (Terrence Howard) is an affable man and plays a lousy trumpet. After dinner, the two youngest daughters, one from either family, leave to go back to Anna's house to get her safety whistle she is supposed to carry at all times.Sometime later Keller realizes the girls haven't returned and that the teens hadn't escorted the two young ones. Keller searches his own home to no avail. Ralph returns from looking also and mentions the RV from earlier.Detective Loki (Jake Gyllenhaal) has Chinese food alone and chats with the waitress. His phone buzzes.After a police hunt, the white RV is found parked outside a gas station next to a wooded area. When Det. Loki, who heads the case, goes to confront the RV's driver, Alex Jones (Paul Dano), Alex panics, tries to speed away but crashes into the trees.Alex is taken in for questioning, but it is found that he has the IQ of a 10-year-old and rarely speaks. Detective Loki goes to see Alex's aunt, Holly Jones (Melissa Leo), who raised him with his uncle after his parents died when he was six. Alex's uncle left home a couple of years ago after a domestic dispute with his aunt. Alex spends most nights sleeping in the RV and does not have many things. The RV shows no forensic evidence indicating the girls were forcibly taken into or struggled inside the RV, and Alex's low intelligence means he couldn't have covered up such evidence.At night many volunteers search the woods calling for the girls. Loki comes to the Birch house and gets better photos of their daughter. At the Dovers, Loki tells Grace they passed the lie detector tests they did, he asks if there was a reason the girls ran away. Grace is weepy and says the girls were happy, Loki vows to find the girl. He greets Keller, who seems sure it must be the RV driver.Loki tells the Dovers the evidence against Alex Jones is weak and tries to calm Keller down. The polygraph tests taken prove inconclusive due to Alex's low IQ, and he repeatedly denies ever having seen the children. As the police are unable to find evidence against Alex, he will be released in two days. Loki asks his Capt to hold Alex longer, but the senior refuses. Loki updates him on the search.Loki interviews sex offenders within a 10-mile radius of the girls' homes. Loki discovers that a Father Patrick Dunn has a bound and mummified body in a barricaded basement. The body is wearing a circular medallion with a maze-like design. Father Dunn claims that he did not know who the man was, but that in confession the man talked about killing sixteen children and also admitted to having a marital dispute. Father Dunn confesses that he convinced the man to come to his house, where he killed him \"to save the children\" and is arrested for murder.The search of the woods and river continues. Keller has found out when Alex is being released and attacks him in the police parking lot. He hears Alex say \"They didn't cry until I left them.\" Though no one is close enough to hear this to corroborate, Keller takes this as proof that Alex took the girls.Captain O'Malley lets Keller off with a warning and sends him home after a brief talk with Loki.At the Jones house, Loki interviews Alex and Holly again about the parking lot incident. He threatens to send the aunt to jail if Alex is not honest. He then leaves and stands in front of an old car.Grace is distraught, Keller gives her a sedative to help her sleep.

The next morning He shows Franklin Birch, the captured man bound with duct tape; Birch is horrified as Keller starts questioning.Detective Loki researches past unsolved missing children's cases. One is Barry Milland, a boy that went missing 26 years ago, when he was six years old. An interview with his mother shows her playing and replaying a VHS tape of him just before his abduction. He interviews Father Dunn again, in custody. Dunn says the man abducted kids in daylight and took more than one at a time. Loki feels the info is useless.

She promises to contact Loki if he comes to the store again.Franklin is overcome with guilt and tells his wife Nancy (Viola Davis) what they have done and brings her to see Keller. Keller brings Nancy to the apartment where Alex is brutally beaten, bloody and tied to the bathroom floor. Shocked, she unties Alex and tries to talk to him nicely, but he attempts to escape. Keller grabs him. Tied again, Alex watches as Keller starts building something from plywood.Later, Keller brings the Birches back to the apartment. Keller has built an enclosure around the bathtub in which he nails Alex. It is devoid of light except for a small PVC tube talk-hole. Keller says otherwise he would kill the man, and challenges the Birches to let him go. Franklin says it has to stop but does nothing when Nancy tells him to think of Joy.While the Birches teen daughter Eliza is in the bath, the strange man walks silently in their house. Later the hooded man enters the Dover's house, Grace hears something and jumps out of bed. She finds an open window and believes Anna had come back. Detective Loki arrives writes down her statement of someone coming in through the window. Grace shows him the basement, Keller's well-organized workshop. Loki sees a bag of lye and asks Grace where Keller is; she says he is out looking for their daughter.In the pouring rain, Loki follows Keller to a liquor store parking lot close to the building where Alex is being confined. Keller realizes the situation as he walks to the building, turns around, and goes into the liquor store instead.Loki wonders what he was doing in the area. Keller approaches with a bottle and asks why he is being followed. He says this is first drink in nine years. Loki urges Keller to take care of himself and his wife. It has been six days, Keller gets very angry, but then goes home to sleep. He dreams he sees Anna.Loki works at his computer. He reads an old news archive of a suicide, which occurred at 234 Campobello, the same location Keller was near.The next day Keller tortures Alex with alternating scalding and freezing water from the shower-head.

The clerk tells Loki the license plate number, and he leaves quickly.Loki confronts Taylor at his home, notices he is strange and forcibly handcuffs him. He calls it in and searches the house.

At the police station, Keller Dover and the Birches identify clothing belonging to their children from the crates, and Taylor confesses to killing them.Taylor is weeping while handcuffed in the interrogation room and draws a maze.

A newspaper headline grabs Keller's attention, the report of Taylor's suicide.Capt. O'Malley tries to tell Loki to get over it, you can't win them all and to find a girlfriend. Loki goes to his workstation in a rage. In a pile of photos, he notices a picture of a maze similar to the one Taylor was drawing. Back at Taylor's house, another cop reveals the blood on the children's clothes is later found to be pig's blood. Taylor is now felt to be a fake killer copying a book titled \"The Invisible Man\" which prominently features mazes, especially a circular maze (seen in the \"O\" in the \"Prisoners\" logo and as the maze medallion worn by the body in Father Dunn's basement) which Taylor was drawing while in custody. Loki can't figure out how Taylor had the missing girl's clothes.He returns to the Dover's house and finds a small sock in the bushes.

At gunpoint, she directs him to an old car outside. She reveals that she and her husband had been religious people, like Keller, until their son died of cancer at a young age.
