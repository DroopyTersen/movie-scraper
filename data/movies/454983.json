    "Born on the same day and time in the same hospital in Los Angeles, California, Elle Evans (Joey King) and Lee Flynn (Joel Courtney) have been best friends all their lives. To keep their special friendship, the pair created a set of friendship rules they promise to follow including rule #9: relatives totally off limits, especially Lee's older brother Noah (Jacob Elordi).

Another student touches her butt which almost gets Lee into a fight but Noah instead jumps into the fight. Elle, violates the dress code so she has to serve detention. Tuppen, the student who touched Elle inappropriately later apologizes. Lee and Elle chat and he approves of her going on a date with Tuppen however Elle is stood up. He goes to see her later that night to let her know that he was threatened by Noah not to go out with her. And finds out that, Noah has told other guys besides Tuppen not to date Elle. Elle and Lee decide to create a kissing booth for the school carnival. The two have difficulty finding people to participate but get a group of popular girls called the OMG's to participate by lying to them about Noahs participation. The kissing booth is a success. However, girls become angry when they discover that Noah is not actually working the kissing booth. Therefore Elle is set up to kiss a nerdy kid while blindfolded however Noah interferes causing him to kiss Elle and when she takes off her blindfold he does it again. After cleaning up Elle sees Noah flirting with another girl so she runs home while Noah looks at her. While on her way home it starts to rain and Noah offers her a ride on his motorcycle. However, the rain gets too heavy and they have to stop. They shelter in a nearby glass 'bandstand' in a park. Elle kisses Noah again and he pulls away. After staring at each other Noah goes in for another kiss.."

  "synopsis": "Born on the same day in the same hospital, Elle Evans (Joey King) and Lee Flynn (Joel Courtney) have been best friends all their lives. They grow up together and do everything together. Specifically fond of dancing. Noah Flynn (Jacob Elordi) is Lee' elder brother and has always protected him from bullies. As Elle grows, she has a secret crush on Noah.\nElle is not into fashion and loves to play soccer. Along the way Elle loses her mom after a long battle with cancer. Well into her teens and Elle has never been kissed or even been on a date.To protect their special relationship, the pair created a set of friendship rules they are sworn to follow.\nRule #2 is never to share their secrets with anyone else.\nRule # 9 is that relatives are totally off limits.On the first day of her junior year in high school, Elle is forced to wear a too-small skirt after her regular pair of pants ripped apart when she put them on. When Tuppen (Joshua Eady) (a football player) touches her inappropriately, Noah begins fighting with him. Tuppen, Noah, and Elle are given detention, where Tuppen apologizes. Elle later agrees to go on a date with him, but he stands her up, as Noah has warned everyone not to pursue her.Lee wants to make out with college pin up Mia (Jessica Sutton). Mia is one of the college popular students called the OMG girls which also includes Olivia (Bianca Bosch) and Gwyneth (Zandile Madliwa).\nThe duo come up with the idea of a kissing booth at an upcoming fundraiser so that Lee has a chance to kiss Mia.\nMeanwhile Elle finds from Tuppen that Noah has been going around college threatening guys not to date Elle.To get their Kissing booth proposal passed from the student council, Elle promises that Noah will be working the booth (to get the girl votes on the council). Plus, she is hopping mad at Noah for trying to control her life.\nThat same night, Elle gets super drunk at a college party (after she sees Noah kissing another girl and egged on by the OMG girls) and takes off her clothes, at which point Noah intervenes and takes her to his home. Noah insists that he sees Elle as his little sister and hence is super protective of her.Meanwhile Elle still has no way of getting Noah to agree to doing the kissing booth. Elle tells the OMG girls that he likes one of them and if they are there, he will do the kissing booth. Elle then begs Noah to stop by the booth for some time as she is desperate.The kissing booth goes well until Noah is meant to participate but Lee takes his place, disappointing the OMG girls.
