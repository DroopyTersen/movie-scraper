Hundreds of years old, the vampires are finding that beyond sunlight catastrophes, hitting the main artery, and not being able to get a sense of their wardrobe without a reflection-modern society has them struggling with the mundane like paying rent, keeping up with the chore wheel, trying to get into nightclubs, and overcoming flatmate conflicts.—Production",

Four nocturnal flatmates and best friends for all eternity--Lord Byron wannabe Vladislav, frilly dandy Viago, rebellious youngster Deacon, and ancient blood-sucking fiend Petyr--prowl the city's night streets for blood. But forever is boring, even for vampires. And then, a small documentary crew expresses interest in recording their lives, giving the strange companions a new lease of life. But trying to fit in the modern world is challenging enough, let alone when you're a vampire. And when the bloodsuckers turn their latest victim into a fresh vampire, unforeseen consequences threaten the group's delicate chemistry. But what will become of the den's warm-blooded guests? Don't they know that being a creature of the night is no bed of roses?—Nick Riganas"

Soon He brings his friend Stu, an IT guy, to the group. Stu introduces the modern information technology to the group and becomes a good friend to them. For this, and because hes Nicks best friend, the group form a pact not to eat Stu.Besides inviting Stu into the group, Nick is quite irresponsible of his newly gained vampirehood. He has been carelessly telling just about anybody that hes a vampire, even showing some of his abilities to complete human strangers. One day, a vampire hunter comes to the flats basement, Petyrs lair. Petyr easily kills the hunter but he dies of sunlight. The group blames Nick for this and banishes him from the flat. Alas, the night for the Unholy Masquerade comes. The masquerade is the once a year night where New Zealands undead community comes and mingles together. Vladislav doesnt go for knowing his nemesis is the events guest of honor. Viago and Deacon go there and find that Jackie has been turned by Nick. They also bring Stu there, still human. Soon the masquerade guests find out that Stu is human and they get eager to eat him. The group manages to get Stu out safely but on their way home they meet their nemesis werewolf pack who are transforming since its a full moon night. They eventually attack Stu and mangle his body.
