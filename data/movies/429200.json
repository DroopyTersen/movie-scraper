While they watch TV, the news shows photos of Connie's face; to distract Crystal, he kisses her. Hearing screams from the other room, Connie realizes the man he broke out of the hospital is not Nick but a man released on parole, Ray.The three drive to the Adventureland amusement park, where Ray stowed a bottle of LSD solution worth several thousand dollars before he ran from police and injured himself. Searching for the bottle, Connie and Ray are discovered by a security guard; Connie beats him unconscious. As police arrive, Connie steals the man's uniform and Ray pours LSD down the man's throat to make him incoherent. Connie convinces the police that the guard was the intruder and destroys a hard drive containing security footage. Police arrest Crystal as she waits outside.Ray and Connie break into the guard's high-rise apartment. Ray begins drinking and Connie tells him he is a leech on society. At Connie's insistence, Ray calls his criminal friend Caliph to buy back the LSD so they can get the bail money. When Caliph arrives, Connie demands $15,000; Caliph agrees, but gestures to Ray that he will retrieve a firearm. Connie flees with the drugs, but is caught by police.
