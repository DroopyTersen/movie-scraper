  "synopsis": "In January 1994, the U.S. Ohio-class submarine USS Montana has an encounter with an unidentified submerged object, loses power, drifts into some under ocean mountain ridges and sinks near the Cayman Trough. before exploding, it launches a buoy for location. With Soviet ships moving in to try to salvage the sub and a hurricane moving over the area, the U.S. government sends a SEAL team to Deep Core, a privately owned experimental underwater oil drilling platform near the Cayman Trough to use as a base of operations. The platform's designer, Dr. Lindsey Brigman (Mary Elizabeth Mastrantonio), insists on going along with the SEAL team, despite her estranged husband Virgil \"Bud\" Brigman (Ed Harris) being the current foreman.Bud's crew includes Alan \"Hippy\" Carnes (Todd Graff), a conspiracy theorist who believes that the NTIs have been covered up by the CIA. He carries a pet rat on his shoulder. Catfish De Vries (Leo Burmester), a worker on the rig and a Vietnam veteran Marine who is skeptical of the SEALs. Lisa \"One Night\" Standing (Kimberly Scott), who operates the deep core submersibles.The whole rig is moved 22 miles to near the last known location of the USS Montana. Deep Core is a private oil rig, but the Navy is forced to use it as a storm front is moving in and they cant get there own submersibles on location and the Deep Core and slide under the storm front, being underwater. The Deep Core also come with an cable attached surface ship, which is also headed into the storm. Lindsey takes the SEAL team from the surface ship into deep Core with a submersible.The entire crew hates Lindsey as she is known as the queen bitch of the Universe. Lindsey has filed for divorce from Bud and is already dating a corporate type with a BMW. At location, the sub is 300m away and 70m below the Deep Core. The Deep core rests at the edge of a precipice. The sub is carrying 24 trident missiles, each with 8 warheads, of 50 kilotons each.During initial investigation of the Montana, a power cut in the team's submersibles leads to Lindsey seeing a strange light circling the sub. Lt. Hiram Coffey (Michael Biehn), the SEAL team leader, is ordered to accelerate their mission (the SEALS thinks that the strange light was a Russian sub) and takes one of the mini-subs without Deep Core's permission to recover a Trident missile warhead from the Montana just as the storm hits above, leaving the crew unable to disconnect from their surface support ship in time (Coffey takes more than 2 hrs to bring back the nuke (without telling Bud or Lindsey) and this meant that the detach operation couldn't be performed on time. In the storm, the surface ship loses its Thrusters and moves out of position).\nThe cable crane is torn from the surface ship and falls into the trench, dragging the Deep Core to the edge before it stops. The rig is partially flooded, killing several crew members and damaging its power systems.The crew wait out the storm so they can restore communications and be rescued. Lindsey takes a walk in a deep dive suit to examine the wreckage of the rig and encounters 2 of the strange lights, one little one and another big one. She later calls a \"non-terrestrial intelligence\" or \"NTI\". She is able to touch them and when she tries to photograph them, they disappear into the trench from where they came. As usual, the power went off when the NTI were around. Lindsey shares with the crew what she saw, it was a machine, but alive.\nRealizing that Coffey is suffering paranoia from high-pressure nervous syndrome, the crew spies on him through a remote operated vehicle, finding him and another SEAL arming the warhead to attack the NTIs. Lindsey is furious at Coffey, but he refuses to back down. He starts spying on Lindsey and overhears her conversation with Hippy who has developed a deep ocean mini sub Pinky, with a camera. Lindsey wants to use the Pinky to search the bottom of the trench of the life forms she encountered outside Deep Core.As they struggle against the cold, they find the NTIs have formed an animated column of water that is exploring the rig. Though they treat it with curiosity, Coffey is agitated and cuts it in half by closing a pressure bulkhead on it, causing it to retreat. Coffey thinks the NTI went straight for the warhead and treats this as a Pre-Emptive attack. Since surface communications are not working, he decides to launch the warhead into the trench tied to Pinky (which Hippy had Pre-Programmed to go right to the trench). To try and stop him, Bud fights Coffey (Coffey had blocked all passages to the launch chamber, but Bud swam outside the platform to access the chamber from outside) but Coffey escapes in a mini-sub with the primed warhead; Bud and Lindsey give chase in the other sub, damaging both (Lindsey and Coffey deliberately run into each other multiple times).Coffey is able to launch the warhead into the trench, but his sub drifts over the edge, crushing him when it implodes. Bud's mini-sub is inoperable and taking on water; with only one functional diving suit, Lindsey opts to enter deep hypothermia when the ocean's cold water engulfs her. Bud swims back to the platform with her body; there, he and the crew administer CPR and revive her after a prolonged struggle.One SEAL, Ensign Monk (Adam Nelson), helps Bud use an experimental diving suit equipped with a liquid breathing apparatus to survive to that depth, though he will only be able to communicate through a keypad on the suit. Bud begins his dive, assisted by Lindsey's voice to keep him coherent against the effects of the mounting pressure, and reaches the warhead. Monk guides him in successfully disarming it. With little oxygen left in the system, Bud explains he knew it was a one-way trip, and tells Lindsey he loves her. As he waits for death, an NTI approaches Bud, takes his hand, and guides him to an alien city deep in the trench. Inside the city, the NTIs create an atmospheric pocket for Bud, allowing him to breathe normally. when Bud is taken to the alien ship, they start by showing him images of war and aggression from news sources around the globe. The aliens then create massive mega-tsunamis that threaten the world's coasts, but stop them short before they hit. Bud asks why they spared the humans and they show Bud his message to Lindsey.On Deep Core the crew is waiting for rescue when they see a message from Bud that he met some friends and warns them to hold on. The base shakes and lights from the trench bring the arrival of the alien ship. It rises to the ocean's surface, with Deep Core and several of the surface ships run aground on its hull. The crew of Deep Core exit the platform, surprised they are not suffering from decompression sickness. They see Bud walking out of the alien ship and Lindsey races to hug him."
