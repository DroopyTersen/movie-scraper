    "In the heart of the 1970s, amidst a flurry of feathered hair and flared jeans, Gru (Steve Carell) is growing up in the suburbs. A fanboy of a supervillain supergroup known as the Vicious 6, Gru hatches a plan to become evil enough to join them. Luckily, he gets some mayhem-making back-up from his loyal followers, the Minions. Together, Kevin, Stuart, Bob, and Otto - a new Minion sporting braces and a desperate need to please - deploy their skills as they and Gru build their first lair, experiment with their first weapons, and pull off their first missions. When the Vicious 6 oust their leader, legendary fighter Wild Knuckles (Alan Arkin), Gru interviews to become their newest member. It doesn't go well (to say the least), and only gets worse after Gru outsmarts them and suddenly finds himself the mortal enemy of the apex of evil. On the run, Gru will turn to an unlikely source for guidance, Wild Knuckles, and discover that even bad guys need a little help from their friends.—Universal Pictures",

  "synopsis": "In 1976, eight years after the events of the first film, 11-year-old Gru (Steve Carell) allowed the Minions to work for him as their new leader.One day, Gru receives an audition invitation from the Vicious 6, a criminal organization founded by the super-villain Wild Knuckles (Alan Arkin); now led by newly appointed leader Belle Bottom (Taraji P. Henson) following Knuckles' death, who hope to find a new member. The gang includes Jean-Clawed (Jean-Claude Van Damme), with a giant mechanical lobster claw for his right arm. Nunchuck (Lucy Lawless), a nun and wields nun chucks. Svengeance (Dolph Lundgren), a roller skater. Stronghold (Danny Trejo), with big metal hands.\nWild Knuckles was in the quest of stealing a stone which has magical properties. He manages to steal the stone and evades the army of evil minions guarding the stone, but while being rescued by belle bottom, he is betrayed, and the entire gang leaves him for dead. Belle plans to use to power of the stone to destroy the Anti Villain league.Dr. Nefario, an absent-minded scientist who runs a record store called Criminal Records. The record store is being as a front by the Vicious 6, and Nefario has no idea of the same.\nMeanwhile Gru studies in elementary school and dreams of becoming a super villain. Gru applied to the opening at vicious 6 and is invited to interview. Gru's interview goes poorly but, much to the outrage of the Vicious 6, he manages to steal a stone capable of turning anyone into one of the animals of the Chinese Zodiac by Chinese New Year.After an escape with Kevin, Stuart, and Bob (all Minions: Pierre Coffin), Gru finds out that Otto, a large, rounded, blabbering Minion with braces, has traded the stone for a pet rock (it had cute eyes and Otto loved it at first sight), causing him to fire the Minions before going alone to find the stone. However, Knuckles, who is revealed to be alive (and was stalking the vicious 6, and had seen Gru steal the stone), kidnaps Gru before taking him to San Francisco.\nKnuckles calls the minions and asks them to deliver the stone in exchange for Gru. The minions force Otto to reveal the house where he made the trade for the stone with a boy. But the boy had already given the stone to his biker uncle. The minions head to San Francisco, as that's where Knuckles had taken Gru. Meanwhile, Otto follows the biker into Death Valley.Without the stone, Kevin, Stuart, Bob set out to San Francisco to find him, ending up piloting a plane there. When they reach Knuckles' house, they are chased by his goons until Master Chow (Michelle Yeoh), a former Kung Fu teacher, helps them out and defeats the goons. Chow decides to teach them after they beg for her to do so. When their teaching is complete, the trio head back to Wild Knuckles' home to try and get Gru back.\nMeanwhile, Otto tries to chase a biker (RZA) who has the stone as a necklace. When he manages to catch up to him at Death Valley, the biker gives the stone back to Otto and takes him to San Francisco.Gru starts to bond with Knuckles after the latter's goons quit on him (as they were beaten up badly by Chow). After saving Knuckles from a crocodile eating him alive in his pool, they decide to rob the Bank of Evil, managing to steal the Mona Lisa. After they get home one night, they see that Knuckles' home has been destroyed by the Vicious 6 (who had been chasing Gru), thanks to Kevin, Stuart, and Bob breaking in earlier. Knuckles decides to give up, causing Gru to take it upon himself to stop them.At a Chinese New Year parade in Chinatown, Otto and Gru find each other with the stone but are cornered by the Vicious 6, who in turn are confronted by the Anti-Villain League. However, after the clock strikes midnight, the Vicious 6 use the stone to turn themselves into animals from the Zodiac, and kidnap Gru, planning to kill him at a clock tower as revenge. Kevin, Stuart, and Bob manage to find Gru, but are turned into a rabbit, a goat, and a rooster, respectively.Knuckles returns and fights Bottom with the Minions. Encouraged by Chow's teaching, the Minions find their inner beast and manage to defeat most of the Vicious 6 but Knuckles is badly burnt by Bottom when trying to take the stone back. Otto manages to save Gru, who uses the stone to turn the Vicious 6 into rats. The Vicious 6 are arrested, including Knuckles, who is taken to a hospital where he succumbs to his injuries. At Knuckles' funeral, Gru gives a heartfelt eulogy, but it is revealed that Knuckles faked his death. Later, he and Gru drive off vicariously into the sunset with the Minions, who are rehired after saving Gru from the Vicious 6.In a mid-credits scene, Gru hires Dr. Nefario (Russell Brand) in gratitude for an invention of his that helped him steal the stone. Nefario originally declines but decides to join him after he and the Minions beg, giving them a ride on a jet, similar to the one Gru would ride in the future."
