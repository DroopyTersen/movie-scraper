    "Lieutenant Frank Drebin discovers that his ex-girlfriend's new beau is involved in a plot to kidnap a scientist who advocates solar energy.",
    "Lieutenant Frank Drebbin returns to save the day once again. This time he's out to foil the \"big boys\" in the energy business. A top scientist (Dr. Mainheimer) is about to publish his report on energy supply for the future. Things don't look good for the traditional suppliers; oil, coal, and nuclear. To save their industries, the suppliers kidnap Mainheimer and replace him with a decoy with a more favorable report. Jane, the doctor's secretary, is Drebin's old flame. Their passionate love affair is thus rekindled.—Rob Hartill",
    "The hard-boiled, maladroit, and single police lieutenant, Frank Drebin, is back in action to right the wrongs, this time, in the renewable energy industry. With Dr Albert Meinheimer's program directly threatening all the major oil, coal, and nuclear companies, and with the beautiful Jane Spencer now in the arms of another man, Frank has his work cut out for him, as powerful enemies intend on replacing the clean-energy advocate with a cunning impersonator. Can Drebin, the grizzled eco-warrior, save the environment? Will Jane realise what she's missing?—Nick Riganas",
    "Lieutenant Frank Drebin loves a mystery. Why are we here? Is there life after sex? Yes, Drebin tackles the big issues, and the biggest of all is how to stop devious Quentin Hapsburg's plan to destroy the environment. Returning are Jane, the woman who can melt a cheese sandwich from twenty paces, the intrepid Captain Ed Hocken, and the man so famous, a beverage was named after him, as hard-luck cop Nordberg."

Zsa Zsa Gabor (Zsa Zsa Gabor) slaps the bell which is following her. Frank ex-girlfriend Jane Spencer (Priscilla Presley) has a new lover, Dr Albert S. Meinheimer (Richard Griffiths).
