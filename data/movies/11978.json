    "The story of Carl Brashear, the first African-American U.S. Navy Diver, and the man who trained him.",
    "The story ultimately revolves around two \"men of honor\"; their relationship, their individual and joint failures and triumphs. Carl Brashear is determined to be the first African American Navy Diver in a time where racism is rife. Leslie Sunday is his embittered trainer, determined to see him fail. Fate, challenges and circumstances eventually draw these two men together in a tale of turbulence and ultimately triumph.—Filmtwob <webmaster@filmfreak.co.za>",
    "Carl Brashear, an enthusiastic dreamer and son of a hard-working and honest Kentucky share-cropper, decides to enlist in the recently desegregated U.S. Navy, in 1948. Thirsting to become the first African-American master diver, the ambitious and driven Carl will let nothing stand between him and his aspirations, not even the ever-present racism and his veteran trainer Master Chief Billy Sunday's intimidations. Undereducated, yet determined to succeed despite the towering obstacles thrown in his way, eventually, Carl will undoubtedly prove his worth, as he finally reaches his goal.—Nick Riganas",
    "Carl Brashear, born in 1931 to sharecroppers, joins the Navy and, after watching the heroics of Billy Sunday, the White son of a sharecropper, determines to become the Navy's first African-American diver. At the Bayonne, N.J., divers' training camp, Sunday is his instructor, and Brasher must endure hazing verging on the murderous. With Sunday and the camp's commander dead set against Brashear's graduating, his physical skills and steely determination, which he got from his father, see him through. Carl and Billy's paths cross again when each needs rehabilitation one from an injury, the other from bitterness. Their wives look on with awe and frustration.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
    "During a time where racism was rampant throughout the entire country. Carl Brashear a young, brash black naval Petty Officer in training is determined to become the very first African-American Navy Diver. This will not be easy for Carl, as a lot of his shipmates and even his trainer Master Chief Billy Sunday wants to see that he fails and quits. It will take all of Carl's strength, endurance and determination to win the respect of his fellow Sailors and make history.—John Wiggins"

  "synopsis": "Master chief Leslie W. Sunday (Robert De Niro) is a US Navy diver & is currently under custody for being AWOL. He is watching a familiar face on TV salvaging a nuclear device on the ocean floor.\nFlashback 25 yrs back, black Carl Braschear (Cuba Gooding Jr.) is going to join the Navy. His poor dad gives him a radio as gift & asks him to be the best. Carl is working in the kitchens on the USS Hoist. Carl is a good swimmer & despite breaking the rules, he is noticed by captain & sent to special training for search & rescue.Sunday is on the ship diving to salvage a mail chopper wreck. His colleague has a freak accident & Sunday risks his life to save his colleague. Sunday suffers damage to lungs which means no more diving. Carl finds this heroic & vows to become a diver.\n2 yrs later Carl reports to Diving school & has no friends. Anyone fraternizing with Carl is thrown out by Sunday. Carl is doing well at physical training, but failing at academics.At the library he meets Jo (Aunjanue Ellis) who is impressed & helps Carl pass at academics. Carl marries Jo. Carl meets Gwen Sunday (Charlize Theron), Leslie's wife. Gwen uses Carl to antagonize Leslie with whom she shares a frosty relationship.\nSunday's CO Pappy asks Sunday to fail Carl, as he cant see a colored man passing his academy.\nThe final test is to assemble a flange underwater with the components sent to the recruits via a bag. Carl's bag is slashed & components spread on the ocean floor. Carl takes 10 hrs but delivers a perfect flange. Sunday refutes Pappy's orders to kill Carl underwater. At a bar Sunday attacks Lt Hanks, the man who discharged him from Navy after his accident. Sunday hates Hanks for ending his career.In prison, Sunday is watching Carl retrieving a nuclear missile from the ocean. Carl finds it, but has a freak accident on the surface ship when the anchor comes loose & shears his leg off. This effectively ends his diving career.\nA couple of yrs later Carl decides to amputate his leg & fit it with a prosthesis to be eligible to resume diving. But Hanks is the new head of the diving certification & plainly refuses Carl. SUnday approaches Hanks & asks for 4 weeks to train Carl & review with the full board members of the diving committee.A month later, Carl appears before the Naval Personnel and they discuss his possible return. Captain Hanks outlines a new requirement for Navy Divers- a new diving suit, weighing in at 290 pounds has been approved for use and anyone wanting to use it must take 12 steps inside it on land. Carl, seeing that Jo and his son are in the audience, volunteers to take the 12 steps right then and there.Chief Sunday steps forward and offers to help Carl suit up, and Captain Hanks allows the trial to go forth. Carl stands up in the new suit, and-with obvious great discomfort- takes a few clumsy steps forward. Everyone assumes that his prosthetic will snap, but Sunday steps forward and begins shouting orders at Carl (identical to their first session at diving school years before). Carl struggles, but keeps moving forward until he has reached the twelfth step. Captain Hanks, realizing that no more can be done, announces that the Navy will be reinstating Carl Brashear to full diving duty.\nCarl completed another 9 yrs in US Navy before his retirement."
