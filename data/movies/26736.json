  "synopsis": "The film follows Alex, Max, Justin and their parents on a trip to the Caribbean. Alex is upset that her parents are telling her what to do despite being sixteen years old. When her parents confiscate her wand, and she gets in a fight with her mother, she wishes her parents had never met. This in turn causes her wish to come true, and her parents forget about each other and about their kids Alex, Max, and Justin. Justin figures his father must still have his powers since his dad and mom had never met and asks his father, who has no recollection of Justin and just regards him as a random tourist and wizard on what to do about the situation, he tells him that they must find the Stone Of Dreams, a magical stone that can reverse any spell and grant any wish. Justin and Alex then embark on a journey to find the Stone Of Dreams along with a not so great street magician and his parrot who have their own plans for the Stone Of Dreams. Meanwhile, Max scrambles to keep his parents from making mistakes that would further endanger the family's future while also trying to make his parents fall in love again."
