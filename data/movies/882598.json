    "After witnessing a bizarre, traumatic incident involving a patient, a psychiatrist becomes increasingly convinced she is being threatened by an uncanny entity.",
    "Having spent years trying to flee her own childhood trauma by working her fingers to the bone, compassionate psychiatrist Dr Rose Cotter is used to treating the most damaged and vulnerable members of society. Laura's puzzling case, however, is a different story. As an unsuspecting Dr Cotter attempts to rationalise the dreadful delusions of the deeply disturbed young woman, hair-raising encounters with the unexplained cause the therapist to reconsider. Now she is losing her grip on reality. Can Rose deal with the ugly past and confront the smile, the unsettling grin of death?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "Dr. Rose Cotter, a therapist who was traumatized by witnessing her mother's suicide at age 10, takes an emergency session with graduate student Laura Weaver after she is admitted to Mount Pleasant Hospital. Laura, who witnessed her professor Gabriel Munoz bludgeon himself with a hammer just a few days earlier, frantically claims she is being haunted by a malevolent presence whose curse has consumed her life and no one but her can see. Although Rose diagnoses her as having hallucinations, Laura insists that the entity has the power to appear as other people wearing an eerie smile. Claiming she is about to die, Laura suddenly freaks out, then begins smiling ominously before cutting open her neck with a broken vase shard in front of Rose.One of the detectives who interviews Rose about Laura's death turns out to be her ex-boyfriend Joel. Still shaken by what she saw, Rose recounts what Laura told her about supposedly being cursed by an evil presence with a haunting smile.Rose begins seeing Laura smiling at her in various places. The visions inspire Rose to look into Gabriel Munoz's suicide and she learns Gabriel was also smiling strangely immediately before he died.Rose checks on her patient Carl Ranken, who was previously admitted to the hospital for a manic episode. Carl smiles ominously and begins threatening and terrifying Rose, which causes her to call security. Orderlies restrain Carl, but it turns out Rose only imagined his aggressive behavior. Believing that Laura's shocking death may have caused a mental breakdown, Rose's boss Dr. Morgan Desai puts Rose on one week's leave.Following another frightening vision of Laura, the security alarm goes off while Rose is home alone. An operator from the security service seemingly calls Rose with a taunting message. The real operator calls Rose shortly thereafter. After her fiancé Trevor returns home, Rose notices her cat is missing.Trevor has to calm Rose when she becomes suddenly spooked again while reviewing audio from her session with Laura.
