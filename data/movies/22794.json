    "Flint Lockwood thinks he's a genius. But none of the things he invented are things that make sense or are useful. However, he has the support of his mother but when she dies, he's left alone with his father who thinks he should give it up. When the community that he lives in is in an economic crisis because their primary source of income, a sardine cannery, was shut down, Flint decides to try his latest invention, a machine that can turn water into food. But something goes wrong and the machine ends up in the atmosphere. Later it starts raining food. The shifty mayor tries to use this as a way to help their community, but when Flint senses something wrong with the machine, the mayor convinces him to ignore it. However, as Flint predicts, chaos ensues.—rcs0411@yahoo.com",

    "A local scientist, Flint Lockwood (Bill Hader), has always been a failure, but when his town is stuck eating gross sardines, Flint wants to help the town so that they don't have to eat sardines anymore. So he invents a machine called The FLDSMDFR, (Flint Lockwood Diatomic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator), a machine that can turn water into food. And he sends it up into the atmosphere and makes food rain from the sky. But suddenly, things get out of hand when The FLDSMDFR creates dangerous food storms. It's up to Flint to stop The FLDSMDFR before it turns the world into a monstrous Foodtopia."

  "synopsis": "Aspiring scientist Flint Lockwood lives in Swallow Falls, a tiny island in the middle of the Atlantic Ocean. Sardines are Swallow Falls' economic source, but the Baby Brent Sardines cannery has gone bankrupt due to worldwide dislike of sardines. One day, Flint invents the \"Flint Lockwood Diatonic Super Mutating Dynamic Food Replicator\" (FLDSMDFR for short), a machine that turns water into food, but requires a large amount of power. Flint decides to power the machine by hooking it up to the large riser pole at the nearby power substation, sending it rocketing through town and destroying a tourist park conceived by the town's mayor before ultimately shooting up into the sky. Afterwards, Flint meets Samantha \"Sam\" Sparks, a weather reporter intern whose big break was ruined by the incident. Brightly colored clouds then float over the town and begin to rain cheeseburgers, delighting the residents.Flint creates a communication device to send food orders to the machine, and Swallow Falls (now renamed Chewandswallow) becomes a successful \"food tourism\" destination. As Flint and Sam grow closer, and Sam opens up to Flint about her history of being bullied and the shame she feels about her nerdy demeanor, though Flint insists she's beautiful the way she is.As the townsfolk become greedier, Flint notices that the food is growing larger. Despite Flint's concerns, Mayor Shelbourne schemes to use the machine for his own personal gain. When a large tornado of spaghetti ravages the town, Flint rushes to his lab to turn off the FLDSMDFR, but Shelbourne accidentally destroys the communication device after ordering a buffet. Now sentient, the FLDSMDFR creates a massive food storm that sends colossal food downpours to various cities and their landmarks.After gaining encouragement from his father Tim, Flint places the kill code in a USB flash drive, and builds a flying car to reach and destroy the FLDSMDFR, with the aid of Sam, her cameraman Manny, Flint's pet monkey Steve, and Brent McHale (namesake of the Baby Brent Sardines cannery). As they approach the machine in the sky, they find that it is now serving as the core of a giant meatball-like object which it created. The machine sends sentient food to attack them which causes the flash drive to fly out the window. Flint calls Tim and orders him to email the kill code file to his phone. As Sam, Brent and Flint enter the meatball, they are accosted by living roast chickens, one of which Brent manages to take control of after it eats him.Back in Chewandswallow, a dam containing leftovers collapses, creating an avalanche of food that destroys the town, but Officer Earl was able to lead the town people to safety by sandwich boats. Tim manages to re-send the code to Flint's cell phone. Back in the meatball, while lowering Flint down a tunnel using rope, Sam gets cut by a piece of peanut brittle, causing an allergic reaction. Flint implores Brent to take Sam back to the plane and get her a shot, but she refuses to let Flint go. They confess their love for each other before Flint cuts the rope and plummets down. Sam and Brent make it back to the car after Brent fights off the roast chickens.While scuffling with the FLDSMDFR, Flint discovers that Tim accidentally sent him the wrong file. Out of options, he uses his Spray-On Shoes formula to block the machine's exit port, destroying it and the giant meatball as he presumably dies in the explosion. The food storms subside and everyone is able to return safely to Chewandswallow, where Flint was revealed to be alive and well. Tim finally shows his appreciation for his son and his inventions, and Flint and Sam celebrate with a kiss. Out at sea, Mayor Shelbourne, who escaped from the food storm on a sandwich boat, begins to sink after eating his boat."
