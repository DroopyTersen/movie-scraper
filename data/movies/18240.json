    "A pushy boss forces her young assistant to marry her in order to keep her visa status in the U.S. and avoid deportation to Canada.",
    "For three years, Andrew Paxton has slaved as the assistant to Margaret Tate, hard-driving editor at a New York publisher. When Margaret, a Canadian, faces deportation for an expired visa, she hatches a scheme to marry Andrew, and he agrees if she will promise him a promotion. A skeptical INS agent vows to test the couple about each other the next Monday. Andrew had plans to fly home that weekend for his grandma's 90th, so Margaret goes with him--to Sitka, Alaska, where Mom, Dad, and Grandma await. Family dynamics take over: tensions between Andrew and his dad, an ex-girlfriend, Andrew's dislike of Margaret, and Margaret's past color the next few days, with the INS ready to charge Andrew with fraud.—<jhailey@hotmail.com>",
    "In New York, Margaret Tate is a successful self-made chief-editor of Ruick and Hunt Publishing and loathed by her coworkers. Margaret lost her parents when she was 16 and is tough with the employees of the office. Her executive assistant and aspirant editor Andrew Paxton has been working with her for three years with no recognition. When Margaret has problems with the immigration due to an expired visa and is threatened with deportation, she blackmails Andrew to agree to marry her; in return, he would be promoted to editor and she would publish his book. Meanwhile, the skeptical clerk of the immigration department, Mr. Gilbertson, schedules an interview with Margaret and Andrew after the weekend. The couple travels to Sitka, Alaska to celebrate the 90th birthday of Andrew's grandmother, and his warm family welcomes Margaret. Over the weekend, she grows closer to Andrew's family, who ask her to marry Andrew in their barn, a family tradition in the Paxton family. And the tension increases when Mr. Gilbertson suddenly appears in Sitka threatening to charge Andrew with fraud.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil"
