  "synopsis": "One year after the Woodsboro killings orchestrated by Richie Kirsch and Amber Freeman, Blackmore University professor Laura Crane (Samara Weaving) is murdered by her student Jason Carvey (Tony Revolori) wearing a Ghostface costume.\nJason plots with his roommate Greg to kill sisters Sam (Melissa Barrera) and Tara Carpenter (Jenna Ortega) to finish the \"movie\" that Richie and Amber wanted to make. However, Jason receives a call from a different Ghostface, who has killed Greg and subsequently stabs Jason to death.Sam and Tara now live in New York City, with Tara attending Blackmore University alongside fellow survivors Chad (Mason Gooding) and Mindy Meeks-Martin (Jasmin Savoy Brown), their roommate Quinn Bailey (Liana Liberato), Mindy's girlfriend Anika Kayoko (Devyn Nekoda), and Chad's roommate Ethan Landry (Jack Champion). Tara is in a relationship with Chad, which Quinn keeps interrupting.\nSam works 2 jobs to pay rent and is overtly protective of Tara, which Tara feels is suffocating.\nSam is seeing a therapist and is taking medications to suppress her hallucinations. Sam's father was a serial killer and last year she found out that her boyfriend Richie was also a serial killer. He only dated Sam as he idolized her father. Sam is ostracized in public because of an online conspiracy theory that she was the true mastermind of the latest killings.\nSam stopped Richie by stabbing him 22 times and slashing his throat.Sam is secretly dating Danny. As news of Jason and Greg's murders is reported on TV, they also talk about Ghostface masks found in their closets. Sam wants to leave town immediately, but Tara is done running. She wont let one incident define the rest of her life.\nGhostface attacks the sisters and leaves behind a Ghostface mask worn in the 2011 Woodsboro killings.At the NYPD police station, the sisters meet Quinn's detective father, Wayne Bailey (Dermot Mulroney), FBI special agent Kirby Reed (Hayden Panettiere), a survivor of the 2011 killings, and reporter Gale Weathers (Courteney Cox), who tells them she spoke to Sidney Prescott and that she has gone into hiding to protect her family.\nSam and Tara are angry with Gale as she wrote a book about what happened, even though she promised she would not. Gale called Sam unstable and a born killer.Sam's therapist Christopher Stone (Henry Czerny) is murdered by Ghostface, who steals Sam's file and leaves behind a mask worn in the Hollywood killings. Wayne suspects that Sam killed her therapist since she had admitted to liking killing Richie and that was also in his session notes, which are now stolen.Mindy theorizes that the killer is following the rules of film franchises, specifically the rule that anyone can die while the franchise will still continue. Ghostface attacks the group in the sisters' apartment, murdering Anika and seemingly killing Quinn. Sam's boyfriend Danny (Josh Segarra) helps the others escape and Ghostface leaves behind a mask worn in the Windsor College killings. Gale takes the group to an abandoned theater she found while investigating, which has been set up as a shrine to the Ghostface killers, featuring many items of evidence related to previous massacres now displayed like film props.Ghostface calls Gale at her apartment and torments her about the death of Dewey Riley before killing her boyfriend Brooks and attacking her. Sam and Tara arrive just in time to stop Ghostface from killing Gale, who is taken to the hospital. The group agrees to meet Kirby at the theater to trap Ghostface. Wayne tells the group to take public transport to avoid the killer from taking another shot at them. But it is Halloween, and many people are wearing Ghostface masks as the news of the killings is trending on social media. Mindy is stabbed by Ghostface on the train.Sam refuses to let Danny inside the theatre as she does not trust him.\nAt the theater, Sam sees a hallucination of her father, original Ghostface killer Billy Loomis (Skeet Ulrich). Billy asks Sam to take a knife and to kill the killers.\nWayne calls Sam and says that Kirby was fired by the FBI 2 months ago for being mentally unstable.\nTaking his knife from the original murders, she realizes they have been locked inside. Two Ghostfaces appear and attack Chad. They manage to stab Tara who was with Chad. As Chad tries to fight them, he is stabbed by both multiple times.\nWayne and Kirby both arrive with guns drawn. Wayne attempts to lend credence toward Kirby being the killer, only to shoot her, revealing himself as a third Ghostface and the mastermind; his accomplices are his children, revealed to be Ethan and a still-alive Quinn, who faked her death to ease suspicion.The trio reveal that they are Richie's family who want to avenge his death. They were responsible for defaming Sam online and plan to frame her for their killing spree. Sam and Tara gain the upper hand and fight off the Bailey family, with Tara stabbing Ethan and Sam killing Quinn, while briefly knocking Wayne unconscious. Sam then dons her father's Ghostface costume, taunts Wayne with a phone call using the voice changer, and viciously stabs him to death. Ethan resurfaces, but Kirby smashes the television set that killed Stu Macher over his head, killing him.Sam agrees to let Tara live her life more independently and Tara agrees to go to therapy. As Mindy, Chad, and Kirby are taken to the hospital, Sam stares at her father's Ghostface mask before discarding it and following Tara and Danny into the city."
