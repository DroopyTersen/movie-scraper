Shortly after Alex, a group of students, and his teacher are thrown off the plane, and to their horror, the plane does explode. Alex must now work out Death's plan, as each of the survivors falls victim. Whilst trying to prevent the next death, Alex must also dodge the FBI, who believe that he caused the explosion.—simon",
    "Death doesn't take no for an answer. Death is coming. And Alex Browning is cursed with knowing when, how and where the grim reaper will take his next victim to the Final Destination. After boarding a plane to Europe with his fellow French club members, high school student Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) has a premonition of the aircraft exploding moments after takeoff, killing every on board. Alex panics, insisting that everyone get off the plane. In the melee than ensues, seven people, including Alex, are forced to disembark--saving them from a fiery death when the plan explodes as Alex foresaw. But as, one by one, each of these seven who cheated fate meets an untimely end, Alex and his remaining friends band together to try change destiny and outwit the untamable forces of death.",

  "synopsis": "Alex Browning (Devon Sawa) is a teenager who has the power of seeing the future.He and 40 of his classmates are going to Paris on a school trip. Just before the plane takes off, Alex has a premonition of the plane exploding, killing everyone. He awakens and screams to everyone that the plane will explode. The guards take him off the plane and onto the airport. During the commotion, teacher, Valerie Lewton (Kristen Cloke), and students Billy Hitchcock (Seann William Scott), Clear Rivers (Ali Larter), Terry Chaney (Amanda Detmer), Carter Horton (Kerr Smith), and Tod Waggner (Chad Donella) get off as well.Soon after, the plane explodes. The survivors are shocked to find Alex's premonition has come true. Days later, Tod slips in his bathroom and falls on a clothesline in his shower. His velocity causes the rope to wrap around his neck and strangles him to death. After his body is discovered, everyone deems it a suicide.Alex thinks that Death is after them since they survived the plane explosion. He figures out that they are meant to die in the order that they died on the plane. He calls Clear and they go to a cafe and talk about Alex's theory. While at the cafe, all the survivors reunite. But Carter and Alex start arguing. Terry, Carter's girlfriend, is enraged at Carter still holding a grudge against Alex. She walks off, only to be hit by a bus.Next on the list is Miss Lewton. She has a series of household accidents that ultimately leads to her computer blowing up in her face, a knife impaling her and her house exploding.The four remaining take off in a car only to have it stall on the railroad tracks. They all get out except Carter, who spots an oncoming train. The others convince him to get out. He decides to get out, and with Alex's help, Carter's death has been intervened. But Billy is decapitated by a piece of thin metal from the car wreckage. Alex figures out that if someone intervenes and prevents the people next in line to die, Death will put that person at the end of the list. Next in line is his girlfriend, Clear Rivers. She is at home when lightning hits a tree causing a chain of events to occur that ultimately find her in her car with a power line on top of it. Alex swoops in again and saves her, cheating death once again.Six months later, thinking they have finally cheated death for good, the three remaining fly to Paris. At a cafe, Alex sees omens around him and thinks that Death is still after them. Walking away, Alex is about to be hit by a bus, without realizing it. Clear has a vision and shouts to Alex and saves him. However, the bus hits a traffic pole, which sends it flying in the air, finally hitting an electrical sign, which says \"CAFE LA MERO 81\" on top of the cafe. The sign comes crashing down, about to hit Alex. Carter comes and saves him. Thinking Death has been defeated, Carter asks Alex, \"Who's next?\". Then the sign comes back down, this time backward saying, \"18o\" and hits Carter.This leaves Clear and Alex the remaining survivors from the first film. It is revealed afterward that Alex was struck in the head by a falling brick. Clear, now powerless, sends herself into a mental asylum."
