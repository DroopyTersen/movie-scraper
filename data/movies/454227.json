  ],
  "synopsis": "In the year 1304, outside the besieged Stirling Castle, John Comyn (Callan Mulvey), Robert Bruce (Chris Pine) and Scottish nobility surrender to King Edward I (Stephen Dillane) of England (as the Scottish King died without naming a heir and the Scottish nobility invited Edward to provide protection, but Edward ended up taking over the territory instead and when Scotts rebelled it led to war, which Scotts lost). King Edward promises to return lands to the nobility in exchange for their homage. During the celebration in the camp, Bruce spars with Edward's heir, the cocky Prince of Wales (Billy Howle), and the King weds Bruce to his goddaughter, Elizabeth De Burgh (Florence Pugh).James Douglas (Aaron Taylor-Johnson) arrives to ask for his lands back, but is rudely dismissed by Edward, who shows his hatred for the Clan Douglas (who he thinks betrayed the English crown in the earlier years of the war). The King and Prince leave Scotland, leaving its management to Comyn, Bruce and De Valence (Sam Spruell) (a faithful noble from Edward's court). Elizabeth arrives to marry Bruce; during the wedding night, Bruce respects his reluctant wife's wishes and delays the consummation. Bruce witnesses Englishmen conscripting his servants to the English army, and the death of his father, the Lord of Annandale (James Cosmo).Two years later, after collecting taxes, Bruce notes how unpopular the English are (there is rioting after the public display of the quartered body of William Wallace (The remaining Scottish rebel noble who had not surrendered 2 years earlier and had gone into hiding)) and starts planning a revolt. He talks about the issue with his family, who agree with him, even the English Elizabeth.Bruce tries to persuade John Comyn to join him. Between Bruce and John, Scots would have 20,000 men and a fighting chance against Edward. Comyn refuses, and threatens to inform Edward about the plan; in a panic, Bruce stabs Comyn to death. The incident compels the clergy of Scotland to offer a pardon to Bruce, with the condition of accepting the crown of Scotland. Bruce accepts the deal, but soon Edward hears, forcing him to declare Bruce an outlaw and send his son to crush the uprising. Bruce calls a council of the nobles, yet most refuse to break their oaths to Edward. Despite the lack of expected support, Bruce heads to Scone, where he is to be crowned; while travelling there James Douglas pledges his allegiance to him. Bruce is crowned the king of the Scots.Ambitious De Valence decides to move against Bruce before the Prince arrives. Bruce wishes to avoid bloodshed and challenges the Earl of Pembroke to single combat; De Valence accepts, but insists on delaying it a day, it being a Sunday. During the night, Bruce finally consummates his marriage, but the English launch a surprise attack. Bruce sends his wife and daughter to safety with his brother and stays to fight a losing battle, during which most of the Scottish army is massacred. Bruce escapes from the bloodbath only with fifty men to his name.\nThe group takes Angus' (Tony Curran) advice and flees to Islay; while traveling there John of Argyll parleys with them. The Lord of Argyll is bitter about the murder of Comyn but allows the army to pass. Later, when making preparations for the flight, Clan MacDougall (MacDougall was the cousin of Comyn) suddenly attacks Bruce's entourage, impelling Bruce to flee across the Loch, but he cannot prevent his brother dying.The Prince finally arrives in Scotland, only to hear that the outlaw has escaped the hand of the law. Edward searches for Bruce at Kildrummy Castle, only to find his wife, daughter, and brother there. The sadistic Prince refuses to believe that Nigel (Lorne MacFadyen) isn't aware of his brother's whereabouts and has him executed. He also has Bruce's daughter and wife taken back to England.Robert the Bruce's company meets up with Lord Mackinnon (Clive Russell), who refuses to lend him any men. The band press on with their voyage to Islay regardless; they learn of the fall of Kildrummy Castle. Bruce decides to take back the castle via stealth. The successful operation inspires Bruce to begin guerrilla warfare. Shortly after starting his campaign, Bruce is reunited with his other brother, Thomas De Brus. In England, Marjorie is separated from her stepmother Elizabeth to be given religious instruction by nuns. After Edward hears that Douglas Castle has been re-taken, he goes after Bruce himself. Elizabeth is offered a pardon for annulling her marriage to Robert, but she refuses and is placed in a hanging cage.The following year, King Edward dies shortly after arriving in Scotland. The Prince of Wales is crowned the new king Edward II. Neglecting his father's dying wishes, he orders his burial in Scotland. Hearing about the death of the king, Bruce decides to fight the new king in a pitched battle at Loudoun Hill, despite being outnumbered six to one. Clan Mackinnon arrives to aid Bruce. Edward II's army is composed almost entirely of horsemen; during the battle the English cavalry charge into a spear wall hidden by a ditch and take heavy losses. The horsemen attempt to attack the flanks, but get bogged down in the mud, just as the Scots anticipated. As they fall from their horses, many English knights are slain. The battle turns into an open brawl, where the ferocious Scots prevail over the disoriented English soldiers. Realizing the battle is hopeless, Valence orders a retreat. However, determined to kill his nemesis, Edward II does not join the retreat. Instead, he engages in a duel with the Bruce while the Scots watch. Although Bruce wins, he allows Edward to leave unharmed, while Scottish soldiers cheer their victory.The epilogue reveals that Elizabeth was released as a part of a hostage exchange; Edward was crowned King, only to be killed by his own lords; and three hundred years later Robert the Bruce's descendant unified the crowns of England and Scotland."
