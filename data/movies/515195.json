    "Struggling to make a name for himself as a singer/songwriter, instead, hopeless Jack Malik is treading water in his career, stuck forever in the coastal town of Lowestoft, UK. Indeed, despite the unconditional support of his manager and best friend since childhood, Ellie Appleton, Jack is going nowhere fast until a cosmic freak accident alters the space/time continuum. Now, as Jack wakes up to find he is the only person on Earth who can remember the hits of the inimitable English rock band, The Beatles, he decides to start playing their songs and passing them off as his own, catching the eye of the English singer, Ed Sheeran, and the American music agent, Debra Hammer. At last, a dream comes true; however, as Jack becomes an overnight sensation, catapulting himself to global stardom, he realises that love is a delicate thing. Can Jack summon up the strength to stop living a lie?—Nick Riganas",
    "Late twenty-something Jack Malik of Suffolk, England, gave up a path to being a schoolteacher to pursue a full-time career as a singer/songwriter, he supported by a close group of friends, most specifically fellow schoolteacher Ellie Appleton, who acts as his part-time manager and who he's known since childhood. Getting nowhere in that music career, which includes needing to work a part-time job he hates as a stock clerk at a big box retailer to pay the bills, Jack decides to give up the music career to return to teaching. Things change following being hit by a bus while out cycling during a momentary worldwide power outage, many authorities believing due to a solar flare. Recovering from his injuries, Jack slowly comes to the realization that many things he knew as reality are no more for whatever reason, the most important of those to him being that The Beatles and thus their music have never existed. Believing it a path back to that music career, Jack starts performing The Beatles songs passing them off as his own. While slow to get notice, Jack does eventually get the attention of music professionals, it the start of the road to stardom. As his fame begins, Jack has to decide what's important to him, his friendship with Ellie, each who can admit to only to oneself that there are stronger feelings more than just friends, which may be a casualty of that stardom. That fame, however, may be at risk if anyone else in the cosmos is aware of The Beatles and thus that he is a fraud.—Huggo"
