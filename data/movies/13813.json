    "Jewish brothers in German-occupied Eastern Europe escape into a Belorussian forest, where they join Russian resistance fighters, and endeavor to build a village, in order to protect themselves and about one thousand Jewish non-combatants.",
    "On the run and hiding in the deep forests of German-occupied Poland and Belorussia (World War II), the four Bielski brothers assist a large community of Jewish refugees and then face the almost impossible task of foraging for food and weapons required for survival over the winter. Led by Tuvia Bielski, the community hides in fear of discovery, contending with neighboring Soviet partisans and unsure whom to trust. People of all ages work to survive, building makeshift homes in the dark, cold and unforgiving forests. They develop relationships, struggle with fear and uncertainty, and manage internal dissent. As Zus Bielski joins the Soviet Partisans, the brothers become part of a larger effort to defeat the Nazis.—Cinema_Fan",
    "In 1941, in Belorussia, the Jewish Bielski brothers succeed in escaping from the massacre of the German in their village where their parents were killed. They hide in the woods and sooner other runaway Jews join them. Tuvia Bielski, the eldest brother, assumes the leadership of the survivors and plans a camp with tasks for everyone in the community; however, his brother Zus Bielski wants to fight against the Germans and does not agree with Tuvia's directions. Zus decides to join the Russian resistance that believes that Jews do not fight. While Tuvia welcomes any survivor in his camp with his two younger brothers and fight for food and ammunition, Zus finds anti-Semitism among the Russian partisans.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "After the German invasion of Poland in September 1939, the Bielski brothers escape the slaughter and hide in the woods. Soon they are joined by many others, all running from the savagery being inflicted on the Jews. The eldest of the Bielski brother, Tuvia and Zus, disagree over what to do with the growing forest population. Tuvia believes that they must welcome anyone who wants to join them while Zus thinks they should be fighting the Germans. After a falling out, Zus joins the local Russian partisans - with whom the Bielskis had already completed an informal truce - and Tuvia stays with their forest community.—garykmcd"

  "synopsis": "The film is based on a true story, beginning in August 1941. Nazi Einsatzgruppen (task forces) are sweeping through Eastern Europe, systematically killing Hebrews. Among the survivors not killed or restricted to ghettos are the Belarusian Hebrew Bielski brothers: Tuvia (Daniel Craig), Zus (Liev Schreiber), Asael (Jamie Bell) and Aron (George MacKay). Their parents are dead, killed by local police under orders from the occupying Germans. The brothers flee to the Naliboki Forest, vowing to avenge the deaths of their parents.\nTuvia doesn't want to confront the Germans head on & prefers carefully planned guerrilla tactics, but Zus is more \"impatient\" and wants direct results.They encounter other Hebrew escapees hiding in the forest, and the brothers take them under their protection and leadership. Although Zus is less enthusiastic about playing protector to his fellow Hebrews, than killing Germans. Over the next year, they shelter a growing number of refugees, raiding local farms for food and supplies and moving their camp whenever they are discovered by the collaborationist police. The joiners in the camp tell Zus that his wife and child have been killed in camps that they escaped from.Tuvia kills the local Auxiliary Police chief responsible for his parents' deaths and the brothers stage raids on the Germans and their collaborators. Casualties cause Tuvia to reconsider this approach because of the risk to the hiding Hebrews. Rivalry between the two eldest brothers, Tuvia and Zus, fuels a disagreement between them about their future; as winter approaches, Zus decides to leave the camp and join a local company of Soviet partisans, while his older brother Tuvia remains with the camp as their leader. An arrangement is made between the two groups in which the Soviet partisans agree to protect the Hebrew camp in exchange for supplies.Asael falls in love with Chaya Dziencielsky (Mia Wasikowska) and eventually gets married to her just before the winter sets in. Lilka Ticktin (Alexa Davalos) is a Polish refugee and Tulia observes her, but never acts on his warm feelings for her.After a winter of sickness, starvation, attempted betrayal and constant hiding, the camp learns that the Germans are about to attack them in force (This was in response to Zus and the Russians attacking a large German military column inside the Jungle, which brought their attention to it). The Soviets refuse to help, and they evacuate the camp as German dive-bombers strike.A delaying force stays behind, led by Asael, to slow down the German ground troops. The defense does not last long; only Asael and a camp member named Sofiya survive to rejoin the rest of the group, who, at the edge of the forest, are confronted with a seemingly impassable marsh. They cross the marsh with only one casualty but are immediately attacked by a German platoon supported by a Panzer III tank. Just as all seems lost, the Germans are assaulted from the rear by a partisan force led by Zus, who has deserted the Soviets to rejoin the group.As the survivors escape into the forest, the film ends as text on the screen states that they lived in the forest for another two years, building a hospital, a nursery, a school, growing to a total of 1,200 Hebrews. Original photographs of the real-life characters are shown, including Tuvia in his uniform and their fates are shared: Asael joined the Soviet Army and was soon killed in action, never getting to see the child he fathered; Tuvia, Zus and Aron survived the war and emigrated to America to form a successful trucking firm in New York City. The epilogue also states that the Bielski brothers never sought recognition for what they did and that the descendants of the people they saved now number in the tens of thousands."
