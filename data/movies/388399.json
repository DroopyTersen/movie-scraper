    "The story of the 2013 Boston Marathon bombing and the aftermath, which includes the city-wide manhunt to find the terrorists responsible.",
    "On April 15, 2013 Boston, Massachusetts, Police Sgt, Tommy Saunders is pulling security duty on the annual Boston Marathon when the Tsarnaev brothers strike with their homemade bombs in an act of terrorism. In the resulting chaos as the wounded are cared for, Saunders and his comrades join forces with the FBI to get to the bottom of this attack. As the investigation continues, the Tsarnaev brothers realize that the authorities are close to identifying them and attempt to flee the city to continue their fanatical mayhem. To stop them, a police manhunt is performed that would have bloody confrontations and a massive dragnet shutting down the City of Boston to make sure there is no escape from the law.—Kenneth Chisholm (kchishol@rogers.com)",
    "The events of the Boston Marathon bombing of 2013, mostly seen through the eyes of Boston Police Department's Sergeant Tommy Saunders, plus other people involved, including the perpetrators. We see everything unfold, from the lead up to the marathon, to the bombing, to the manhunt for the killers.—grantss",
    "The movie begins on April 14, 2013, a day before the marathon. The next day, brothers Dzhokhar and Tamerlan Tsarnaev detonate two bombs during the Boston Marathon, causing widespread panic. A young couple, Patrick Downes and Jessica Kensky, are injured and taken to separate hospitals, where they are both required to have their legs amputated. Steve Woolfenden, a family man, is also injured and separated from his toddler son, Leo, who is taken by the police to a safe location.",
    "On the last day of his suspension--as Massachusetts prepares for the demanding annual Boston Marathon--reluctantly, the injured Boston police sergeant, Tommy Saunders, arrives at the bustling-with-people finish line, on April 15, 2013. But, under everyone's noses, amid enthusiastic but unsuspecting spectators, the terrorist Tsarnaev brothers have planted two lethal home-made pressure-cooker bombs. And at the height of the event, the terrorists remotely set them off, killing three people and maiming 264 civilians. Now, with the city plunged into chaos, a relentless area-wide manhunt begins, as the authorities, the F.B.I. and Tommy's comrades-in-arms comb the town to track down the murderers. Will the Bostonians let hate stain Patriots' Day?—Nick Riganas"
