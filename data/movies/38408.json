They struggle to learn how to care for Sophie and to get along with each other. This goes on and once Holly leaves Sophie with Messer while she covers an important catering job - the same night that he is given the opportunity to direct a big basketball game.

This date is cut short when Messer calls and explains Sophie is unwell by having a fever then Messer needs to take Sophie to the hospital. Later, Messer sees Holly kissing Sam.
