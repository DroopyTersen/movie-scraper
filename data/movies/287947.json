He comes out and says we need more money. They go to an ATM, zapping it and taking some of the money, using it to purchase merchandise.Next day at school - the bullies begin to mess with Freddie and Billy again until Freddie tells them he knows the new hero \"Red Cyclone\" - they don't believe him but he promises and tells them that he'll get him to show up to lunch tomorrow. Freddie and Billy get into a bit of an argument over him just assuming and trying to use Billy for his powers. That night at dinner the father asks the family what they think of the new hero - everyone gives input and Freddie takes a dig at Shazam and then him and Billy get into a bit of an argument leaving the rest of the family confused.At school the next day, Billy decides not to attend school because he wants to find his mother, despite Freddie asking for lunch. Shazam does various things, taking selfies, and showing off lightning for money. He sees and saves Mary from being hit by a car, and talking to her makes him realize she is upset that, because of college, she will have to leave her family. Shazam accidentally reveals he knew her name and housing situation, but leaves. Freddie finds Shazam and tries to talk to him, yet Shazam tries to diffuse it, shooting lighting that hits the tires of a bus across the city, sending it off the side of the bridge. Catching it, Shazam puts it on the concrete, only to be promptly told he's not using his powers right. Hearing the commotion, Dr. Sivana shows up and demands the powers that Shazam possesses.

Freddie is there and is taken hostage by Sivana, who demands to be taken to Billy.Billy shows up, and they know with Eugene telling him where his mother is; she is only 2 subway stops away. Billy rushes out of his house, with his foster parents in tow. Back at the house, Sivana shows up with Freddie and traps the children. Billy arrives at his mother's apartment complex. His mother informs Billy he was intentionally abandoned on that day, and saw him with the police and that he would be better cared for by others since she was 17. Controlling his emotions in the face of the heartbreaking reality that his stubborn years-long search for his mother was for nothing, Billy quietly reassures his mother that he is fine, but he has to return to his real family. However, Billy gives his mother the key-chain compass she gave him years ago with a comment mixed with regret, resentment and understanding about her, \"You might need it more than me.\" Leaving, he receives a call and Sivana tells him to come home. Billy jumps off the apartment building and transforms to Shazam and flies home.Shazam decides to give up the power to save his family and Sivana opens a magical door to the Rock of Eternity.

Shazam and Sivana end up on a rooftop and Shazam goads the one deadly sin who remained -- Envy. It rips itself out from Sivana's eye and Shazam yells Shazam, hurting it. Sivana is knocked off the roof, now mortal. Shazam grabs Sivana and drags him to the carnival, ripping the magical eye out. Saving the day, the Shazam family basks in the cheers of the crowd, takes the eye back to the lair, and return the sins for keeping. Shazam and Freddie decide this is their lair.
