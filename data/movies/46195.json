    "When Blu, a domesticated macaw from small-town Minnesota, meets the fiercely independent Jewel, he takes off on an adventure to Rio de Janeiro with the bird of his dreams.",
    "In Rio de Janeiro, baby macaw, Blu, is captured by dealers and smuggled to the USA. While driving through Moose Lake, Minnesota, the truck that is transporting Blu accidentally drops Blu's box on the road. A girl, Linda, finds the bird and raises him with love. Fifteen years later, Blu is a domesticated and intelligent bird that does not fly and lives a comfortable life with bookshop owner Linda. Out of the blue, clumsy Brazilian ornithologist, Tulio, visits Linda and explains that Blu is the last male of his species, and he has a female called Jewel in Rio de Janeiro. He invites Linda to bring Blu to Rio so that he and Jewel can save their species. Linda travels with Blu and Tulio to Rio de Janeiro and they leave Blu and Jewel in a large cage in the institute where Tulio works. While they are having dinner, smugglers break into the institute and steal Blu and Jewel to sell them. Linda and Tulio look everywhere for Blu, who is chained to Jewel and hidden in a slum. Meanwhile, Jewel and Blu escape from their captors and befriend a group of birds that help them to get rid of the chains. It is Carnival and the smugglers and mean cockatoo, Nigel, do not intend to give up Blu and Jewel, and chase the birds through the crowded streets.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "When Blu, a baby blue macaw that lives in Brazil, was captured by dealers and was smuggled to USA, a little girl named Linda decided to take care of him and it continues until they were adults. Unfortunately, because Blu was with Linda since he was little, he never learned to fly. And when an ornithologist named Tulio finds Blu and tells Linda that he is the last male of his kind, Tulio decided to bring Blu back to Brazil to breed with a female macaw named Jewel. But in the night Blu was captured again along with Jewel and must find his way back to Linda while trying to overcome his fear to learn how to fly with Jewel and a toucan, Rafael.",
    "By a tragic twist of fate, the bright-coloured blue macaw parrot, Blu, never had the chance to learn how to fly. Far away from sunny Brazil, Blu now lives in snow-covered Minnesota as the pet-friend of his human companion, Linda; however, as the last of his endangered species, the flightless bird will soon find himself in Rio de Janeiro to meet the last female of his kind--the feisty, Jewel. But, when calamity strikes again, and the feathery couple gets kidnapped, Blu must summon up the courage to finally believe in himself, if he wants to save his charming dream-girl. The question is, can he make it in time?—Nick Riganas",
    "After meeting each other, two blue macaws are kidnapped by bird smugglers and must work together, and with new friends, to return home. along the way, they get to know one another and realize that they have more in common than they originally thought.—RECB3"

  "synopsis": "In Brazil, various exotic birds are smuggled out of the country. In Moose Lake, Minnesota, a crate with a male blue macaw Hatchling falls out of a truck and is found by a little girl named Linda Gunderson, who names him Blu. Fifteen years later, Linda owns a bookstore. Blu, highly domesticated and unable to fly, is ridiculed frequently by the Canada Geese that come by outside of Linda's bookstore.One day, ornithologist Túlio Monteiro invites Blu and Linda to Rio De Janeiro on the condition that Blu, who is the last male of his species, mates with a female macaw. Linda accepts and they fly to Rio, where Blu meets a Red-crested Cardinal named Pedro and his Yellow Canary friend Nico. At Túlio's aviary, Blu meets Jewel, a fiercely independent blue macaw longing to flee into the wilderness. The macaws are captured by Fernando, an orphaned boy, and a Sulphur-crested Cockatoo named Nigel, both of whom work for a group of smugglers led by Marcel, who wants to leave the country as soon as possible to secure a black-market deal regarding Blu and Jewel.While Fernando has second thoughts about his actions, Nigel tells the macaws that he vowed to smuggle exotic birds in revenge after his role on a television program had been replaced by one. However, because of Blu's familiarity with cages, they flee into the jungle. Fernando meets Linda and Túlio and helps them find the birds, while Blu and Jewel meet Rafael, a Toco Toucan, who offers to take them to his bulldog friend, Luiz, to remove their leg chain. He attempts to teach Blu how to fly, before they meet up with Pedro and Nico. Nigel hires a horde of thieving marmosets to capture Blu and Jewel. Pedro and Nico then take the two to a birds' Rio-style dance party, where they perform a duet and begin to fall in love but encounter the marmosets in the process.The birds fight them off while the five escape on a tram. Fernando takes Linda and Túlio to the smugglers' hideout, where they discover that the birds have already been moved out. Marcel explains that he will use the Rio Carnival parade to smuggle the birds to the airport, as the other streets have been blocked off for the festivities. Meanwhile, Blu and the others meet Luiz, who releases the chain holding Blu and Jewel. After the two get into a heated argument, they decide to go their separate ways, despite both their heartbreak and Rafael's protests.Pedro and Nico then witness Nigel capturing Jewel. When Blu and Rafael learn of it, they rush to the carnival to rescue her. Meanwhile, Linda and Túlio have spotted the smuggler's parade float and organize a rescue attempt for the birds. As Linda and Túlio pose as dancers in blue macaw costumes, Nigel captures Blu and the group. Linda and Túlio are unable to stop the smugglers in time and Marcel's group takes off in a Short SC.7 Skyvan.On board, Blu destroys his cage using a fire extinguisher and releases the captive birds, but Nigel injures Jewel. Blu sends Nigel flying into the plane engine using the fire extinguisher, causing the plane to fall. The smugglers flee the plane. Unable to fly, Jewel falls out of the plane's open cargo hatch towards the ocean. Jumping out of the plane to rescue her, Blu finally discovers that he is able to fly and carries her to Linda and Túlio for help. Later, they adopt Fernando and organize a sanctuary to protect the jungle from smugglers.In the end, Blu and Jewel raise three children together and celebrate with their friends, Nigel is ridiculed for his loss of feathers, and the smugglers are sent to jail."
