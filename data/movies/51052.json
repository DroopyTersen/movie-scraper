  "overview": "Each Christmas, Santa and his vast army of highly trained elves produce gifts and distribute them around the world in one night. However, when one of 600 million children to receive a gift from Santa on Christmas Eve is missed, it is deemed ‘acceptable’ to all but one—Arthur. Arthur Claus is Santa’s misfit son who executes an unauthorised rookie mission to get the last present half way around the globe before dawn on Christmas morning.",

But at the center of this movie is a story about a family in a state of comic dysfunction and an unlikely hero, Arthur (James McAvoy), with an urgent mission that must be completed before Christmas morning dawns.—Sony Pictures Animation",
    "It is Christmas Eve. The big hi-tech sleigh, the S-1 is to deliver two billion presents on Santa's (Jim Broadbent's) seventieth mission. Meanwhile, Arthur gets a letter from a girl from 23 Mimosa Avenue, Trelew, Cornwall, England, saying that she wants a Pink Twinkle Bike for Christmas. The S-1, which is the answer to every child's question: How does Santa deliver all those presents in just one night, travels seven million miles around the world delivering the gifts. However, during a delivery operation, when one child wakes up and almost sees Santa, an elf inadvertently presses a button, causing a present to fall off a conveyor and go unnoticed. A crazy wrapping elf called Bryony (Ashley Jensen) discovers the gift, and Arthur is alarmed to discover that it was the present for Gwen Hines (Ramona Marquez), the Twinkle bike. Grandsanta (Bill Nighy) proposes delivering the gift using Evie, his old wooden sleigh, and the descendants of the original eight reindeer, forcefully whisking away a reluctant Arthur and a stowaway Bryony. They get lost, lose reindeer, and land in danger several times, ultimately being mistaken for aliens and causing an international military incident. Can Arthur, with the help of Grandsanta and Bryony really be the heroes of the night and deliver the missing present before Gwen wakes up, thus saving Christmas?—Nicky Mitchell",

Produced by Aardman Features in association with Sony Pictures Animation, this fun-filled holiday movie introduces viewers to Santa's mischievous son Arthur (James McAvoy), who races to complete an important mission in time to ensure that this year's Christmas celebrations will go off without a hitch."

  "synopsis": "Arthur Christmas reveals the incredible, never-before seen answer to every child's question: 'So how does Santa deliver all those presents in one night?' The answer: Santa's exhilarating, ultra-high-tech operation (with a spaceship for delivery of gifts) hidden beneath the North Pole. Arthur is the clumsy son of Santa, who has a good heart & cares for the wish of each & every kid in the world. While Steve is the military disciplinarian who keeps the whole operation going. Steve expects Santa to hand over the reins to him as Santa's dad, grandpa Santa, did to him years ago. But after the 70th successful mission, Santa does not announce the transition, disappointing Steve.That night an elf discovers that by mistake 1 gift was not delivered. Arthur is mortified but Steve convinces Santa that there no way to deliver that gift without endangering the elves or incurring a great expense. Arthur is dejected, when Grandpa Santa tells him there is a way & unveils the family sleigh & his reindeer. He asks Arthur to accompany him as he tries to deliver the gift before sunrise to the girl in England. Grandpa Santa is no longer familiar with the maps & reaches Toronto & then across the Atlantic, but reaches Africa, & thinks he is in France. They are attacked by lions & barely escape, but the sleigh is damaged including grandpa's camera. Grandpa is angry because he wanted his picture taken when he went down the chimney as proof that he did it his way. For him it was not about the wishes of a little girl.Arthur is disappointed but still heading towards Cornwall, but the GPS navigator had the wrong address typed in & they reach Mexico instead. That address already had all gifts delivered. Arthur & Grandpa again head to England with literally less than an hour to sunrise. Steve call them & asks them to return home. He convinces Arthur that Santa doesn't care about 1 little kid.In the meantime, all the elves get a whiff of 1 child being missed & wake up Santa. He tries to explain but can't. They all head to Steve who again says that Santa doesn't care about 1 kid. The elves are horrified & Santa disagrees with him but without having a clue on how to rectify the situation. He is further mortified to know that Grandpa Santa & Arthur are out there trying to reach the kid (they have fallen out of the sleigh & now lying on the coast of Cuba). Arthur is still determined to reach the kid & uses the magic dust to capture the sleigh again & heads to England.Meanwhile Santa has decided to go to the kid himself & commanders the spaceship. He doesn't know how to fly it & Steve comes into the cockpit to help him out. They both take off.\nThe elves think that the Santa are deserting & that the kid doesn't matter. They press the auto destruct button on the North Pole. Meanwhile NORAD is tracking grandpa's sleigh as an alien invasion & sends in drones. As they near Cornwall England, Grandpa releases Arthur & the Reindeers & allows the missiles to destroy the sleigh.While Steve makes the same mistake & lands in Cornwall, Mexico. He is terrible with kids. Meanwhile Arthur races towards to house in Cornwall, but sunrise happens just as he reaches the outside door. Just then Santa reaches there with the spaceship & uses the camouflage option to again make it night over Cornwall.The elves see Arthur trying to make the kid happy & suspend the auto destruct countdown.\nThe 3 Santa reach the house at the same time & Arthur delivers the gift. They hide in the closet to see the kid's reaction & her happiness that Santa delivered the gift she wanted. Santa admits to Steve that he deserves to be Santa but wonders if the girl is right. Steve agrees & Arthur is the new Santa.Nest year, Santa has retired & joined Grandpa. Steve is the Head of operations, COO. Arthur is the new Santa & orders that the spaceship be renames Eve, after the old sleigh & be pulled by 5000 reindeer powered by magic dust."
