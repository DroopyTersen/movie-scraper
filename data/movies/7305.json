    "After crash-landing in the snowswept Andes, a Uruguayan rugby team has no choice but to turn to desperate measures in order to survive.",
    "In 1972, the Uruguayan rugby team is flying to Chile to play a game. However, the plane from the Uruguayan Air Force with 45 people crashes on the Andes Mountains and after the search party, they are considered dead. Two months after the crash, the 16 survivors are finally rescued. Along the days, the starved survivors decide to eat flesh from the bodies of their comrades to survive.—Claudio Carvalho, Rio de Janeiro, Brazil",
    "When a rugby team's plane to Chile crashes in the Andes Mountains, they will do anything to survive, even if that means they must eat their dead loved ones as food. Nando, Reberto, and Tintin leave the plane to find the tail to work the radio. Once they bring it back, it doesn't work, so they go out again but Tintin stayed back or went back. Nando and Roberto find the green valleys of Chile and finally breach the Andes and find help. The obstacles they faced were avalanches, food, shelter, and a way to escape. They accused the pilots of being drunk and it was their fault. The good thing is that they escaped.",
    "In 1972, a rugby team from South America goes to Chile to play a game. As they approach, they crash in the Andes mountains and struggle to survive. They have to go through eating their loved ones, avalanches, and finding the tail to the plane to get the transmitter since the batteries are in the tail. They also meet this guy who has mental issues. Will they make it out alive?"
