Despite this and other differences including that she's rich, he's poor, she's a city girl, and he's a country boy the two become fast friends. Together they create Terabithia, a land of monsters, trolls, ogres, and giants where they rule as king and queen.",

    "A preteen's life turns upside down when he befriends the new girl in school and they imagine a whole new fantasy world to escape reality.",
    "Growing up in the redneck country isn't easy for shy Jess Aarons, with a father struggling to make ends meet and two arrogant bigger sisters. In class he bonds with cheeky newcomer Leslie Burke, whose writer parents moved into the neighboring house, despite her taking his only local prestige by beating him in a school race. Having wandered off into the woods after school, they invent a fantasy land called Terabithia, where they can be the superheroes of imaginary feral races. Together they also stand up against bullies, but then tragedy strikes, and Jess must adjust again.—KGF Vissers",
    "A little imagination can sometimes go a long way. The story of young and artistically talented Jess Aarons, who is sharing concerns and money problems with his family. He's having trouble at school with the bullies and a bully like troll who charges the kids a dollar to go and pee. He is fighting for the attention of his father against his baby sister. Life for him isn't looking up until the adventurous, imaginative and non-conformist Leslie Burke arrives in town. Together they form a bond and Jess' life shall never be the same again. Adventures and amazement in other worlds center around these two kindred spirits, and for once, life for Jess isn't so bad after all.—Cinema_Fan",
    "Jess Aarons comes from a poor farm family with four annoying sisters, and he finds no haven at school where he's teased by everyone. The only thing he has is running; after training all summer for the big race on the school athletic day, he and every other boy racing are beat by newcomer Leslie Burke. Like him, she is teased by her schoolmates, but unlike him she doesn't let it bother her. After a rocky start, they find common ground and together create the imaginary world of Terabithia as a haven from their struggles at school and home. Leslie teaches Jess to open his mind to every possibility and leave reality behind. But, after a tragedy occurs, he must trust in what she has taught him to help overcome the horrors that reality can bring.—O.G.",
    "Jess Aarons trains all summer to win the big race at school, only to have newcomer Leslie Burke beat him, along with everyone else. Despite all their differences, they quickly become friends and discover a magical kingdom across the creek. They name it Terabithia, where they have many adventures together and show each other how to stand up to the bullies at school.—soccerchica23"
