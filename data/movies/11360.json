    "The stork delivers a baby elephant to Mrs. Jumbo, veteran of the circus, but the newborn is ridiculed because of his truly enormous ears and dubbed \"Dumbo\". After being separated from his mother, Dumbo is relegated to the circus' clown acts; it is up to his only friend, a mouse, to assist Dumbo to achieve his full potential.—Tim Pickett <quetzal@yoyo.cc.monash.edu.au>",
    "Mrs. Jumbo sadly looks on how babies are delivered by stork to colleague circus-animals but as even a baby elephant makes a most cumbersome package, so her so is just last to arrive, but soon becomes a laughing stock for the jealous herd because of his more then jumbo-size ears, so he gets nick-named Dumbo. When she can't stomach the public making fun of her firstborn, she is locked up as mad elephant, and the taunted kid finds himself all alone; well, except for a self-appointed mentor-protector, Timothy Q. Mouse who keeps motivating Dumbo. Alas, he's demoted to clown. When everything seems lost, they accidentally discover how they ended up in a tree with a bunch of crows.—KGF Vissers",

One day at a show, he is taunted by a group of kids, inciting his mother into a rage that gets her locked up. After Dumbo's ears cause an accident, he is made to dress like a clown and perform dangerous stunts. Everything changes when Dumbo discovers his new talent.—Jwelch5742",
    "Ridiculed for his outstanding, floppy, and oversized ears, mama-elephant Mrs Jumbo's precious newborn boy is cruelly nicknamed Dumbo. Mistreated and ostracized by the circus' entire elephant community, little Dumbo finds himself all alone after an unfortunate incident, and as if that weren't enough, the circus ringmaster makes him part of the clown act. Now, Dumbo's only friend, mentor, and the voice of reason is Timothy Q. Mouse: a compassionate and dauntless minuscule ally who takes the boy under his wing, stands up for him, and sticks by his side to help him rescue his mother. However, will the extraordinary, blue-eyed baby-elephant believe in himself, and spread his wings?—Nick Riganas"

  "synopsis": "While a large circus spends the off-season in the \"Winter Grounds\" in Florida, a flock of white storks delivers babies to the animals. One elephant, Mrs. Jumbo (Verna Felton), does not receive her baby, and keeps scanning the sky. The circus sets out on a new tour, and a belated stork (Sterling Holloway) catches up with the moving train and drops off the expected baby elephant, Jumbo Junior. Casey Junior (Margaret Wright), the sentient 2-4-0 tender locomotive hauling the circus train.\nThe other elephants (Catty (Noreen Gammill), Giddy (Dorothy Scott), Prissy (Sarah Selby)) are initially delighted, until they see the baby has far-oversized ears, and promptly nickname him \"Dumbo\". However, Mrs. Jumbo shows her baby great care and love, defending him from the teasing of the other elephants.The circus reaches its new destination and sets up camp. The crews work all night in heavy rains to set up the main tent.\nDumbo, clumsy due to his ears (he keeps tripping himself on his ears), is made into a sideshow attraction. When some rowdy boys start blowing in and pulling Dumbo's ears, Mrs. Jumbo spanks their leader and throws hay bales at them. Circus staff remove Dumbo from the pen, and Mrs. Jumbo flies into a rage, eventually dousing the ringmaster (Herman Bing) (who, though not truly evil, is a strict, greedy, and arrogant man who exploits workers and animals) in a water tub. She is subsequently deemed mad and locked in a cage. Dumbo is blamed for the incident and shunned by the other elephants.Timothy, a mouse (Edward Brophy) (an anthropomorphic mouse who becomes the only friend of Dumbo, along with the crows) that travels with the circus, befriends Dumbo and decides to make him a star. He whispers in the ringmaster's ear while the latter sleeps, and convinces him to try a new stunt with Dumbo as the top of a pyramid of elephants. However, Dumbo trips on his ears during the show and knocks over the pyramid, injuring the other elephants and bringing the big top crashing down. After this, the other elephants exile Dumbo completely, and he is put in with the clowns' firemen act, regularly jumping from a \"burning building\" prop into a vat of pie filling. Despite his newfound popularity, he hates the job and becomes depressed.Timothy decides to take Dumbo to see Mrs. Jumbo, but they cannot see each other's faces and can only intertwine trunks. Meanwhile, the clowns decide to increase the popularity of their fireman act by dangerously raising the platform Dumbo jumps from. In celebration of the plan, they drink champagne, and a bottle of it falls into a water vat. Dumbo, crying after visiting his mother, gets the hiccups, so Timothy takes him to the vat for water. Both of them get drunk, and hallucinate pink elephants.Dumbo and Timothy are later discovered asleep high up in a tree by Dandy Crow (Cliff Edward) (the leader of a group of crows) and his friends (Deacon (Hall Johnson), Fats (James Baskett), Specks (Nick Stewart), Dopey (Jim Carmichael)). Initially making fun of Timothy's assertion that Dumbo flew with his ears while drunk, the crows are soon moved by Dumbo's sad story. They decide to help Timothy, giving him a \"magic feather\" to help Dumbo fly. Holding the feather, Dumbo does indeed take off a second time, and he and Timothy return to the circus with plans to surprise the audience.During the clowns' act, Dumbo jumps off the platform and prepares to fly. He drops the feather, but Timothy assures him it was only a psychological aid, and Dumbo successfully flies about the big top, much to the delight of the public. Dumbo gains fame and fortune, Timothy becomes his new manager and signs him to a Hollywood contract, and Mrs. Jumbo is freed. She and Dumbo are given a private coach on the train, and the crows wave goodbye to the elephants as they travel away."
