    "After graduating high school from the Maryland School of the Arts (MSA), Moose, with his longtime BFF and fellow MSA alumnus Camille, decides to \"grow up\" by quitting dance and becoming an engineering student at NYU, much to the delight of his parents. An impromptu street dance battle in New York City in which Moose is involved against Kid Darkness of the renowned House of Samurai dance crew catches the eye of Luke, the leader of the House of Pirates dance crew. Luke convinces Moose to join his crew, which is comprised of a group of misfits who each has his/her own individual dance style. Luke and his crew live in what is called the vault - a converted warehouse - which has a living and dance rehearsal space upstairs and a dance club downstairs. Luke has his own personal reasons for creating the vault and helping these dancers. However, he is five months behind in the mortgage payments and the bank could foreclose at any second. Luke believes winning the $100,000 grand prize in the inaugural World Jam Championships would solve his financial problems. The Samurais, led by Luke's nemesis Julien, are their main competition. Beyond the prestige, Julien has his own motive for wanting to win and ruin the Pirates. Luke is also trying to recruit Natalie, a recent attendee to the downstairs club. In getting to know Luke, Natalie tries to get him to follow his own dreams. But Natalie's involvement with the Pirates may threaten its existence. Meanwhile, Moose is trying to balance his secret involvement with the Pirates against his commitments to school and to Camille, who secretly wants to be more than just a platonic BFF to Moose. But Camille may be able to take only so much neglect from Moose before even their BFF status is placed into jeopardy.—Huggo",
    "Orphaned would be-filmmaker Luke uses his trust fund to host a 'crew' of talented street kids sharing his other passion, hip-hop dance. His latest brightest recruit is small NYU engineering freshman Moose, accidentally discovered by brilliantly winning an impromptu street challenge and accepts joining, while pressed for time by studies and best friend since childhood Camille. To prevent the cool place being bought by Luke's nemesis Julien, his Pirates must earn the fat cash prize of the 'first annual World Jam' in several rounds at different colorful New York clubs. Luke also takes in drifter Natalie, who becomes his lover, ignoring she's a spy planted by her brother Julien.—KGF Vissers"
