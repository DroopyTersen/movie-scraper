    "1666. An unspeakable evil has cast its unholy shadow over Union, the original settlement before its division into Sunnyvale and Shadyside, ushering in a new era of misfortune and terror. In the aftermath of the brutal mall killings in Fear Street: Part One - 1994 (2021), Deena finds herself plagued by vivid, blood-curdling visions of death and decay, forcing Cindy Berman, the only one who saw the sorceress and survived, after the bloody Camp Nightwing massacre in Fear Street: Part Two - 1978 (2021), to step in. Now, there is no turning back, and until body and hand unite, no one is safe from the fiery curse of damned Sarah Fier. But evil has no boundaries. What will it take to rid Shadyside of the witch's sin?—Nick Riganas"
