  "synopsis": "Ray, along with his wife Joanne and daughter Peri, drive on a road trip for Thanksgiving. They take a break at a rest stop, where Ray and Peri fall into an open construction site and are injured. After rushing to the hospital, Joanne accompanies Peri to the basement to obtain a CT scan while Ray waits in the waiting room.Ray passes out from exhaustion. After awakening hours later, he asks the hospital staff if he can see his wife and daughter, but is told they were never brought to the hospital.Ray argues with the hospital staff, who all deny that his wife and daughter were ever admitted. Ray enlists the assistance of two police officers, but the hospital staff and doctors convince them Ray came to the hospital alone, was treated for a head wound, and is confused.Unable to convince the staff and police of his story, Ray searches for his family on his own and eventually finds them in the sub-basement, just before his daughter is about to have her organs harvested. Ray fights with the hospital staff, causing an explosion, and escapes with his family.However, as Ray drives away, it is revealed that he is experiencing visual hallucinations from psychological trauma resulting from the incident earlier that day. In reality, Peri died from the fall, and Ray accidentally killed Joanne after pushing her. The trauma of realizing he'd killed his family caused Ray's mind to construct a new reality in which both his wife and daughter are alive. Ray believes he is rescuing them, but it is revealed that he has kidnapped a random patient from surgery, while his wife and daughter are lying dead in the trunk of his car."
