    "A chaotic battle ensues between Jerry Mouse, who has taken refuge in the Royal Gate Hotel, and Tom Cat, who is hired to drive him away before the day of a big wedding arrives."
  ],
  "synopsis": "In a world co-populated by humans and cartoon animals, Tom Cat, who dreams of becoming a pianist, moves to Manhattan and lives in Central Park while Jerry Mouse is in search of a new home. After Tom's keyboard is destroyed in an altercation (Tom was collecting money by pretending to be a blind cat who plays the piano and Jerry tries to raise money by dancing in front of Tom's piano.. When Tom catches Jerry, he is revealed not to be blind and people take their money back), he chases Jerry, but accidentally tackles a young woman named Kayla Forester (Chloë Grace Moretz) (a young inexperienced wedding planner of the Royal Gate Hotel), causing her to lose her job.Down on her luck, Kayla wants to prove her talents and looks for a position at New York's fanciest hotel, the Royal Gate, where Jerry moves in and Tom fails to break in. Kayla, with a stolen resume (of a woman who was at the hotel to apply for the job. Kayla pretends to be hotel staff who was shadow interviewing the woman and proceeds to reject her), is hired to help plan a high-profile wedding and gets a tour of the hotel, while Jerry's usual antics involve stealing food and items to ramp up his new home, and Tom plans more strategies to enter the hotel and capture Jerry.Terrence was against hiring Kayla. The Royal Gate is an exclusive hotel with 260 rooms and 104 suites. Water pressure is never below 50 PSI and thread count is never below 800. Chef Jackie (Ken Jeong), is a Michelin star chef and baker at the Royal Gate Hotel. Joy the Bell Girl (Patsy Ferran), a socially awkward Royal Gate Hotel bellhop. Cameron (Jordan Bolger), a bartender at the Royal Gate HotelLocal celebrities Preeta Mehta (Pallavi Sharda) (the bride of the Royal Gate Hotel's planned wedding) and her fiance Ben (Colin Jost) are greeted, as they arrive, along with their pets Toots and Spike respectively. All, except for Spike, are unaware of Jerry stealing from Preeta's handbag. Kayla saves the day by suggesting a dog park where Ben can take Spike for an evening walk discreetly.As the couple and their pets are escorted to their room, Jerry's presence is revealed (when he runs through the kitchen for a piece of cheese) , which puts the wedding and the hotel at risk. Kayla offers to catch Jerry, but fails and realizes that he'll be hard to catch. After many failed attempts, Tom successfully enters the hotel, and his ensuing chase after Jerry wrecks a hotel room. Due to noise complaints, Kayla comes to check, but she befriends Tom, due to their shared goal of catching Jerry. Owner Mr. Dubros (Rob Delaney) (a jovial general manager and owner of the Royal Gate Hotel) hires Tom to exterminate Jerry on Kayla's recommendation, while Tom and Kayla's boss Terence (Michael Peña) (the event manager of the Royal Gate Hotel) threatens to fire them, if Tom can't catch Jerry.After many failed attempts (Jerry gets Tom to attack Spike. Meanwhile Toots is a vicious cat and almost corners Jerry when she is called away by Preeta) (Joy takes Kayla to a new tiny door she found on the 10th floor and Kayla finds Jerry there. Jerry refuses to vacate the hotel and laughs at Tom as her enforcer), Tom designs an elaborate mouse trap and gets Jerry out of the hotel. Meanwhile, Kayla helps with the wedding plans and learns from Preeta that her engagement ring is missing. Tom has a crush on Toots.Jerry returns and reveals to Kayla that he had Preeta's ring, and he agrees to give it back to her, if she lets him live in the hotel. Before Kayla can agree, Terence returns from walking Spike, and notices Tom looking for Jerry hiding in Kayla's coat pocket, but creates a huge scene that causes Spike, Tom, and Jerry to destroy the hotel's lobby.\nKayla finds Preeta's ring in her pocket.Terence is suspended for causing damage to the hotel lobby, while Kayla is promoted to event manager, for returning the ring stolen by Jerry. Kayla tells Tom and Jerry that they will have to get along and spend the next day bonding, if they want to stay in the hotel, to which they reluctantly agree. While Kayla takes care of the hotel and manages the wedding with the crew (including accommodating elephants and peacocks and other exotics that have been ordered for the main ceremony), Tom and Jerry explore the city, but are imprisoned at a pound, after inadvertently disrupting a New York Yankees baseball game by committing fan interference. Kayla talks to Preeta about why she doesn't push back Ben as she clearly doesn't want a huge wedding. Preeta simply says that she is trying to maintain an image of what is expected of her.A vengeful Terence separately visits Tom and Jerry, and feeds them lies of what they said about each other behind their back. Tom and Jerry are eventually released from the pound Terence and taken back to the hotel. Terence's words incite them to a battle at the ceremony that throws the wedding into carnage (jerry spooks the Elephants, who do the rest) and destroys the rest of the hotel.After Kayla comes clean and leaves in humiliation, Terence evicts Tom and Preeta renounces the wedding. A sorrowful Tom and Jerry put their differences aside, and convince Kayla and the hotel crew, including a skeptical Terence (she knows what Terence did to release Tom & Jerry from the pound, and promises not to tell anyone), to salvage the wedding. While the pair lure Preeta and Toots to Central Park, where the wedding is held at. Kayla promises to Preeta that Tom and Jerry have atoned for their behavior, and Ben apologizes to Preeta for his extensive expenses, in light of impressing her dad. Kayla and the stolen resume's owner reconcile with each other and get jobs at the hotel, while Tom strives to be a pianist and plays the piano for Toots, with Jerry joining the party, until a mishap causes them to fight again.In a post-credit scene, Ben receives a bill for both weddings."
