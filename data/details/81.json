    "Warrior and pacifist Princess Nausicaä desperately struggles to prevent two warring nations from destroying themselves and their dying planet.",
    "Set one thousand years from now, the Earth is ravaged by pollution and war. In the Valley of the Wind lives Nausicaä, Princess of her people. Their land borders on a toxic jungle, filled with dangerous over-sized insects. Meanwhile, two nearby nations are bitterly engaged in a war and the Valley of the Wind is stuck in the middle.—grantss",
    "In the aftermath of the Seven Days of Fire, an unavoidable conflict of apocalyptic proportions that destroyed civilization and the Earth's ecosystems, noxious fumes and mutated insectile behemoths threaten the remaining humans. And then, a millennium after the destructive war, ruthless invaders set foot in the verdant Valley of the Wind, a peaceful community ruled by a charismatic young leader. But a toxic forest of dangerous fauna and flora encircles the land. As blind ambition and stubborn disregard for all living things trigger a new murderous clash between warring human factions, the valley becomes the breeding ground for unbridled violence and methodical annihilation. With nature's survival hanging by a thread, can valiant Princess Nausicaä restore peace and stability before it's too late?—Nick Riganas"
