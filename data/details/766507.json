    "Naru, a skilled warrior of the Comanche Nation, fights to protect her tribe against one of the first highly-evolved Predators to land on Earth.",
    "Set in the Comanche Nation 300 years ago, this is the story of Naru, a fierce and highly skilled warrior, raised in the shadow of legendary hunters who roam the Great Plains. When danger threatens her camp, she sets out to protect her people. The prey she stalks: a highly evolved alien predator with a technically advanced arsenal.",
    "The Northern Great Plains, North America, 1719. Determined to prove her worth and join the ranks of the tribe's warriors, Naru, an expert Comanche tracker and healer, hones her combat skills. Constantly in the shadow of her skilled hunter brother Taabe, Naru gets the chance to shine when a brutal mountain lion attack brings to light something far more sinister than the virgin habitat's savage beasts of prey. And after seeing a sign in the morning sky, Naru realises she is ready for the big hunt--her rite of passage. However, does sharp-witted Naru have what it takes to confront the Predator (1987)?â€”Nick Riganas"
