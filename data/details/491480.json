    "Against all the odds, a thirteen-year-old boy in Malawi invents an unconventional way to save his family and village from famine.",
    "William Kamkwamba was born in the country of Malawi, in Africa. When he was fourteen years old, a terrible drought hit the village where he lived. People had nothing to eat. Being an excellent student and very fond of physics, William decides to save his native village from starvation. In the library he finds books on physics. After studying the books, he got an idea to build a wind generator, to provide electricity to his family.â€”Peter-Patrick76 (peter-patrick@mail.com)"
