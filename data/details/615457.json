    "A docile family man slowly reveals his true character after his house gets burgled by two petty thieves, which, coincidentally, leads him into a bloody war with a Russian crime boss.",
    "Emmy winner Bob Odenkirk (Better Call Saul, The Post, Nebraska) stars as Hutch Mansell, an underestimated and overlooked dad and husband, taking life's indignities on the chin and never pushing back. A nobody. When two thieves break into his suburban home one night, Hutch declines to defend himself or his family, hoping to prevent serious violence. His teenage son, Blake (Gage Munroe, The Shack), is disappointed in him and his wife, Becca (Connie Nielsen, Wonder Woman), seems to pull only further away. The aftermath of the incident strikes a match to Hutch's long-simmering rage, triggering dormant instincts and propelling him on a brutal path that will surface dark secrets and lethal skills. In a barrage of fists, gunfire and squealing tires, Hutch must save his family from a dangerous adversary (famed Russian actor Aleksey Serebryakov, Amazon's McMafia)-and ensure that he will never be underestimated as a nobody again.—Universal Pictures",
    "Trapped in a mundane existence, Hutch Mansell, a glum, humble, workaday suburban father, is petrified when violent burglars break into his home, threatening his wife and children. In the wake of this soul-scarring incident, one good deed and several broken bones--and teeth--later, suddenly, imperfect Hutch summons up the courage to stand up for himself, only to find himself targeted by the murderous Russian drug lord, Yulian Kuznetsov, and his brutal henchmen. It seems that Mansell has a death wish; however, in this world, there are two kinds of people: wolves and lambs. The question is, which one is Hutch?—Nick Riganas"
