    "A young New York socialite becomes interested in a young man who has moved into her apartment building, but her past threatens to get in the way.",
    "Holly Golightly, an elegant Upper East Side socialite spending her time between wild parties and mysterious day trips to Sing Sing, is confident that she has seen and done everything before. But her life is about to get complicated. As if trying to find an identity weren't challenging enough, the impeccably dressed fortune hunter finds herself off guard when struggling writer Paul Varjak becomes her new neighbour. But Paul, too, isn't impervious to Holly's effortless allure. Little by little, as the handsome tenant surrenders to the moment, eager to hijink around the city in the name of fresh excitement, sublime feelings of tenderness flood Paul's world-weary heart. After all, the uninspired author and the unstoppable dream girl are meant for each other, even though they quietly struggle to keep their past at bay. Now, potent feelings have the final say; there's no room for pride in love. And in New York City's bustling Fifth Avenue, a romance blooms. Can an early morning breakfast at Tiffany's be the prelude to a breezy love affair?—Nick Riganas",
    "Struggling writer Paul Varjak moves into a New York apartment building and becomes intrigued by his pretty, quirky neighbor Holly Golightly. Holly's lifestyle confuses and fascinates Paul; in public she flits through parties with a sexy, sophisticated air, but when they're alone she changes into a sweetly vulnerable bundle of neuroses.—filmfactsman"

  "synopsis": "Holly Golightly (AUDREY HEPBURN) lives in a brownstone on Manhattan's swank East Side. Totally madcap, she has a partially furnished apartment, owns a cat with no name, gets rid of the \"mean reds\" by visiting Tiffany's jewelry store, and is forever misplacing her door key, much to the dismay of her upstairs neighbor Mr. Yunioshi (MICKEY ROONEY), a Japanese photographer. Holly makes her living in two ways: she receives $50 from her gentlemen escorts whenever she needs powder room money, and she is paid $100 for each weekly trip she makes to Sing Sing Prison, where she visits Sally Tomato (ALAN REED), an ex-mobster. One day Paul Varjak (GEORGE PEPPARD), a young writer who is supported by an older woman nicknamed \"2E\" (PATRICIA NEAL), comes into Holly's life. Following one of Holly's wild cocktail parties hosted by her Hollywood agent, O.J. Berman (MARTIN BALSAM), Paul unexpectedly meets Doc Golightly (BUDDY EBSEN), a gentle Texan whom Holly married when she was only 15 years old. Holly explains to Paul that the marriage was annulled long ago, and he helps her send the heartbroken Doc away. After a day on the town together, Paul realizes that he is in love with Holly and proposes to her; but she is determined to marry José (VILALLONGA), a South American millionaire. However, when it is publicly revealed that Holly has been innocently carrying narcotics ring information from Sally Tomato to his New York associates, the stuffy José abandons her. Furious at everything and everyone, Holly kicks Cat out of her taxicab into the rain and decides to leave town for Brazil, but Paul lectures her and then goes out to find Cat. Holly realizes how much she is giving up and races through the wet New York streets to a happy reunion with Paul and Cat."
