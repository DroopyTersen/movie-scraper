    "A runaway slave forges through the swamps of Louisiana on a tortuous journey to escape plantation owners that nearly killed him.",
    "Over 150 years from today, back in 1863 at Lousiana, a black slave, Gordon, had dreamt of the freedom of black people. Freedom means living their life to the fullest, just like their \"White\" masters: who considered themselves god of 'these Animals'. 'Emancipation' is a tale of a black slave who fought his whole life to live with honor, dignity, and of course, a \"Normal life\" This is the tale of a person who risked his life to join the Lincoln Army, fighting to free his fellow brothers-sisters-sons-daughters. This image of Gordon was taken in 1863 after he managed to be free from his slave master. This is the most accurate depiction of slavery I've seen.",
