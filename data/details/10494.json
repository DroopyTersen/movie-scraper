However, her bold choice doesn't sit well with the young band's male admirers, especially the unknown die-hard fan who starts posting insidious threats and disturbingly intimate information about Mima's life on her blog--entries Mima swears aren't hers. Now, all those who talked Mima into embracing her \"bad girl\" persona end up brutally murdered, and a menacing doppelgänger harasses her.
